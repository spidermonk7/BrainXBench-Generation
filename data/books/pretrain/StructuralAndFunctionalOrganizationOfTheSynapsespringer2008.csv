1.2 Molecular Architecture of NMDA Receptor Subtypes 
Similar to AMPA and kainate receptors, NMDA receptor subunits share a common 
membrane topology. Each subunit consists of a large extracellular amino terminal 
domain, the bi-lobed agonist binding domain, three transmembrane domains (mem-
brane associated regions M1, M3, and M4), one cytoplasmic re-entrant pore loop 
(referred to as the P-region for pore forming region, or alternatively M2 for the sec-
ond membrane-associated domain), and an intracellular carboxyl terminal domain 
(Fig. 2). The ion channel pore region of NMDA receptors, which bears strong re-
semblance to an inverted potassium channel architecture, is composed of the re-
entrant pore forming loop from all four subunits. Among NMDA receptor subunits, 
the sequences of the pore region are highly conserved and this region determines 
basic permeation properties. One of the key determinants of ion permeation for 
NMDA receptors resides at the apex of the re-entrant pore forming loop, which is 
sometimes referred to as the Q/R/N site on the basis of amino acid residues found at 
this position in AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors. This site partially defines the 
Ca2+ permeability as well as the sensitivity to Mg2+. 
 
Two modular semi-autonomous extracellular domains are thought to be encoded 
by each subunit. The amino terminal domain is composed of approximately the first 
350 amino acids of the protein and appears to form a clamshell-like structure, which 
shows sequence homology with bacterial leucine/isoleucine/valine binding domain 
as well as the glutamate binding site of the G-protein coupled receptor mGluR1. The 
amino terminal domain interacts with various extracellular allosteric modulators such 
as zinc and polyamines, plays an important role in subunit assembly, and influences 
deactivation (see below). This domain can also bind allosteric regulators such as 
ifenprodil. Although no crystallographic structural information exists describing the 
amino terminal domain, important insights have been derived from structural models 
(Fig. 2) (88, 109). 
 
The glutamate and glycine binding domains are formed by two lobes referred to 
as D1 and D2, which are composed jointly of S1 (the polypeptide chain between 
the amino terminal domain and the first transmembrane domain) and S2 (the ex-
tracellular polypeptide chain between the second and third transmembrane do-
mains) (see Fig. 2). The NR1 subunit binds glycine, whereas the NR2 subunit 
binds glutamate. These regions fold into a hinged bi-lobed, clamshell-like structure 
that contains the agonist binding site. This domain has been crystallized ((46, 47, 
56) see below), and shows sequence homology with bacterial periplasmic amino 
acid binding proteins such as the glutamine binding protein (QBP) and ly-
sine/arginine/ornithnine-binding protein (LAOBP). The agonist binding site likely 
exists as a pair of NR1/NR2 heterodimers that form an extracellular portion of the 
tetramer (47)."

assembled from subunits with a highly modular structure comprised of four discrete domains: 
two large extracellular domains referred to as the amino terminal domain and the agonist 
binding domain, a transmembrane domain that forms part of the ion channel pore, and an 
intracellular carboxyl terminal domain. The agonist binding domain is defined by two seg-
ments of amino acids termed S1 and S2. The transmembrane domain contains four membrane-
associated regions: three membrane-spanning helices (M1, M3, and M4, sometimes referred to 
as TM1, TM2, TM3) and a membrane re-entrant loop (M2). Soluble recombinant proteins 
containing the isolated S1 and S2 segments have been constructed by deleting the amino 
terminal domain along with the transmembrane domain and joining S1 and S2 with at hydro-
philic linker (dashed line). In these structures, the agonist binding domain exists in a bi-lobed 
clamshell-like arrangement with the agonist binding pocket located deep within the cleft"

2 Structure and Function of Agonist Binding Domain 
While much has been learned about the structure and function of AMPA receptors in 
the past 10 years, crystal structures of the glutamate binding domain of NMDA re-
ceptors have only recently been solved. The release of these structures has provided 
a great deal of information about the agonist binding domains of NMDA receptors, 
and provided a means by which to interpret a large amount of mutagenesis work. A 
number of excellent reviews have summarized the structure-function relationship 
derived from this crystallographic data (22, 50, 67, 91, 94). 
2.1 Structural Features of the NR2 Glutamate Binding Site 
When the structure of the NR2A agonist binding domain in complex with the NR1 
agonist binding domain was described (47), it provided the first experimental struc-
ture of the glutamate binding site of the NMDA receptor as well as the first structural 
information about the heterodimer interface within the NMDA receptor multimeric 
complex. The existence of this interface between NR1 and NR2 provides a possible 
structural explanation for allosteric interactions observed between glutamate and 
glycine. This allosteric interaction is shown by NR2 control of glycine potency at 
NR1 (98) as well as glycine-dependent desensitization (see below). The agonist 
glutamate binds in the cleft between the two clearly defined lobes (D1 and D2) of the 
agonist binding domain, near the hinge region (Fig. 2). The lower half of the binding 
pocket is formed largely by the ends of helix F and helix I. Residues from loops 
within the upper lobe (D1) form most of the upper half of the binding pocket, al-
though an arginine (Arg499 in NR2A) is located on a more distant helix with the 
length of its side chain allowing it to reach the ligand. The pocket is largely lined with 
polar amino acid side chains, although some aromatic character is provided by a his-
tidine (His466 in NR2A) and two tyrosines (Tyr711 and Tyr742 in NR2A) (Fig. 2). 
Virtually all of the contact residues in NR2A are analogous to contact residues in

minal domains and the transmembrane domains relative to the agonist binding domains is 
unknown. The amino terminal domain is a homology model build from the crystal structure of 
the glutamate binding site of mGluR1 (PDB code 1EWK). M2 and M3 of the transmembrane 
domain is a homology model based on KcsA contributed by Johnson and Beth Siegler-
Retchless. (c) Binding of glutamate in the ligand binding pocket of the NR2A agonist binding

dues is according to the mature protein excluding the signal peptide. (d) Binding of glycine in 
the ligand binding pocket of the NR1 agonist binding domain crystal structure (PDB code

NR1 residues is according to the total protein including the signal peptide."

AMPA and kainate receptor binding pockets. Despite being tucked away between the 
lobes, the binding site is fairly accessible to water, with 6 water oxygens found within 
4 Å of the NR2A-bound glutamate. Two of these waters form hydrogen bonds with 
bound glutamate, one with the amino group and one with the γ-carboxyl group (47). 
 
In addition to this contact with water, the γ-carboxyl group of the glutamate ago-
nist also makes hydrogen bond contact to the side chain and backbone amide of a 
threonine (Thr671 in NR2A) (Fig. 2). The amino group of glutamate forms hydrogen 
bonds with the backbone carbonyl of a serine (Ser492 in NR2A), the side chain of a 
threonine (Thr494 in NR2A), and the previously mentioned water molecule. In 
NR2A, the α-carboxyl group of glutamate forms a bifurcated salt bridge with 
Arg499, as well as hydrogen bonds with the amide backbones of both Ser670 and 
Thr494. 
2.2 Determinants of Glutamate Binding and Function  
within the NR2 Subunit 
Prior to the crystallographic data, many residues were suggested to influence gluta-
mate binding on the basis of mutagenesis studies (summarized in (22, 32)). For ex-
ample, Anson et al. (3) probed the glutamate binding site of NR2A using site-
directed mutagenesis. Three of ten mutations (H466A, G669A, and T671A) were 
found to increase the EC50 of glutamate by over 100-fold, with the effect of the 
NR2A(T671A) mutation increasing EC50 over 1000-fold. His466 and Tyr671 contact 
glutamate in the crystallographic structure and Gly669 is proximal to glutamate and 
mutation of Gly669 likely disturbs the structure of the binding pocket. More re-
cently, effects of mutations at agonist contact residues were examined for several 
different agonists and partial agonists of NR2A (21). 
 
Although only structural information for the NR2A agonist binding domain ex-
ists, investigations on other NR2 subtypes have resulted in important data about the 
function of these. Recent studies have examined the effects of mutants in the agonist 
binding site of NR2B, and suggested structural roles for several of these mutants on 
the basis of changes in potency and efficacy of glutamate and several other ligands 
(31, 50, 78). A molecular dynamics study of NR1/NR2A and a homology model for 
NR1/NR2D ligand binding domains showed similar contact residues in the NR2A 
and NR2D glutamate binding pockets, with the exception of Tyr711 (Tyr732 in 
NR2D), which forms an inter-domain bridge in NR2A and a direct ligand contact in 
NR2D (42). These similar contacts occurred although simulations showed differ-
ences between NR2A and NR2D in the placement of the D2 region, specifically in 
helix F. Mutagenesis studies support the proposed difference in the NR2D pocket, 
and also predict that a number of additional inter-domain hydrogen bonds in NR2D 
enhance the affinity of that subunit for glutamate. Interestingly, 4-methyl glutamate 
can distinguish between the NR2A and NR2D binding pockets, with the methyl 
group clashing with Tyr711 in NR2A because of its position as an inter-domain con-
tact. However, the corresponding residue in NR2D (Tyr732) bends out of the way as it 
makes contact with the agonist, creating space for the 4-methyl group. This leads to a 
50-fold increase in potency of (2S,4R)-4-methyl glutamate (SYM2081; (42)) for NR2D 
over NR2A."

2.3 Structural Features of the NR1 Glycine Binding Site 
Glycine was first found to potentiate NMDA receptors, and later argued to be a 
required co-agonist for NMDA receptor activation (60, 70, 81). Mutagenesis stud-
ies provided the initial evidence that the NR1 subunit harbors the glycine binding 
site (77, 145, 150), which was subsequently confirmed when structures of the NR1 
agonist binding domain were solved by Furukawa and Gouaux (46). The binding 
pocket for the co-agonist glycine in NR1 is situated similarly within the agonist 
binding domain as the glutamate pocket was in NR2, primarily formed by residues 
at the end of two D2 helices and loops from D1. The pocket is smaller and more 
hydrophobic than that found in NR2A, with Phe484, Trp731, and Phe758 replacing 
the three more hydrophilic aromatic residues in NR2A (His466, Tyr711, and 
Tyr742) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, Thr671 in NR2A is replaced by a valine in NR1 
(Val689). The hydrophobic Val689 and the larger hydrophobic residues Phe484, 
Trp731, and Phe758 likely occlude binding of glutamate to NR1. Glycine binds 
deeper between the two lobes, and is less exposed to water than glutamate in 
NR2A. The amino group of glycine forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl back-
bone of Pro516 and the side chains of Thr518 and Asp732. The alpha-carboxyl of 
glycine forms a similar hydrogen bonding interaction as seen with glutamate, a 
bifurcated salt bridge with Arg523, and interactions with the backbone amides of 
Thr518 and Ser688. Structures are also available for the endogenous agonist D-
serine, which shows additional interactions between the hydroxyl of D-serine and 
residues Thr518 and Ser688. 
 
A pair of cysteine residues within the NR1 subunit are conserved across the 
glutamate receptor family (NR1 Cys744 and Cys798), and have been proposed to 
form a site that is sensitive to redox potential (1, 133). These two residues are 
oxidized in the crystal structure, and the resulting disulfide bond imparts some 
conformational constraints on the receptor. Mutagenesis studies suggest that relief 
of this constraint in NR1 (but not NR2) by reduction of the Cys744-Cys798 disul-
fide bond enhances receptor function (133), apparently by increasing channel 
opening frequency with little effect on single channel conductance or channel open 
time (135). Interestingly, NR1(C744A) and NR1(C798A) mutations enhance the 
potency of NMDA acting at the NR2 subunit by an unknown mechanism (133). 
Several other disulfide bonds exist within the crystallized NR1 and NR2A sub-
units, although functional effects of their reduction or oxidation have not yet been 
described (46, 47). 
2.4 Determinants of Glycine Binding and Function  
within the NR1 Subunit 
Multiple ligands have each been crystallized in the NR1 agonist binding domain (46, 
47, 56), providing a structural basis for understanding the effects of partial agonists, 
agonists, and antagonists. Similar to previous structures of related glutamate receptors 
as described in the chapter by Mayer, the antagonist 5,7-dichlorokynurenate stabilizes 
an open-cleft conformation of the NR1 agonist binding domain, resulting in a loss of 
24 degrees of domain closure when compared to the glycine-bound structure. The"

stabilization of an open-cleft conformation of the agonist binding domain is similar 
to what has been found for the soluble agonist binding core of AMPA and kainate 
receptors. However, despite this similarity, the structure of NR1 bound by partial 
agonists was unlike that observed for AMPA and kainate receptors. While previous 
structures of AMPA receptor glutamate binding domains showed partial domain 
closure that correlated with the efficacy of the partial agonist (e.g. (58)), no such 
relationship was seen in the NR1 agonist binding domain. Multiple structures 
showed that the partial agonists D-cycloserine, ACPC, and ACBC bound with virtu-
ally identical degrees of domain closure of NR1 compared to the glycine complex. 
By contrast, a more subtle effect is revealed in the incremental shift in the position of 
helix F and the hinge region between the two lobes of the clamshell structure (56, 
71). These and other data (see (71) suggest that the position of helix F may influence 
efficacy, or perhaps may be involved in translating the effects of agonist binding to 
gating. 
 
Interestingly, the heterodimer interface between NR1 and NR2A may also impact 
receptor function. Three separate areas of contact between NR1 and NR2A were 
identified from the dimer crystal structure (47). Mutagenesis in the two outer regions 
(sites I and III) was shown to influence dimerization of the soluble agonist binding 
domains of NR1 and NR2A. Modification of site II, which is analogous to a binding 
site for small ligands that modulate deactivation in AMPA receptors (59, 96, 107), 
impacts deactivation with different mutants of Tyr535 in NR1 capable of increasing 
or decreasing the rate of deactivation. These results suggest domain interface stabil-
ity can control NMDA receptor function, similar to what has been found for AMPA 
and kainate receptors as discussed in the chapter by Mayer. 
2.5 Agonist Binding to the NR3 Subunit 
Several groups simultaneously isolated cDNAs that encoded proteins with similarity 
to the NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2 (27, 132). The two subunits compris-
ing this new subfamily (NR3A and NR3B) appear to co-assemble with the NR1 
subunit alone to produce glycine-activated excitatory currents (16). In addition, the 
NR3 subunit can also co-assemble with the NR1 and NR2 subunits as heterotrimeric 
receptors. NMDA receptors containing the NR3 subunit show reduced Ca2+ perme-
ability, reduced sensitivity to voltage dependent block by extracellular Mg2+, and 
reduced single channel conductance (16, 27, 90, 102, 108, 120, 132). A soluble 
NR3A agonist binding domain has been purified, which shows high affinity for gly-
cine (40 nM) and pharmacology distinct from the NR1 subunit (157). The NR3A 
subunit also binds D-serine with lower affinity than glycine. Interestingly, glycine 
binding to the NR1 subunit appears to play an auto-inhibitory role in NR1/NR3A 
heterodimers, since NR1-selective antagonists can enhance glycine-evoked current 
(87). This suggests a strikingly different role of the NR1 subunit in NR1/NR3 recep-
tors compared to NR1/NR2 receptors, which require glycine binding to NR1 for 
activation."

and Channel Block 
3.1 Receptor Gating 
NMDA receptor activation is a complex series of events that start with agonist bind-
pore, block and unblock by Mg2+, and cation permeation. The structural basis of the 
mechanisms that control the opening and closing of the channel are not fully under-
stood. The activation of NMDA receptors requires the binding of glutamate and 
glycine to the receptor. Although the structure of the apo form of the NR1 or NR2A 
agonist binding domain has not been described, we will assume NMDA receptors 
generally bind glutamate as AMPA or kainate receptors do. In this scenario, the 
initial interactions of glutamate with its binding site are associated with a rapid rear-
rangement of the agonist binding domain that involves closure of the angle between 
the two lobes that comprise the clamshell binding site. This leads to association of 
the γ-carboxyl of glutamate with the lower portion of the bi-lobed binding site, and 
the ultimate formation of intra-lobe hydrogen bonds. The resulting energy associated 
with closure of the clamshell structure is conveyed through long range intra-protein 
interactions to cause the structure of the channel to undergo a conformational change 
that opens a permeation pore. There is as yet insufficient structural or functional data 
 
Site-directed mutagenesis studies show that all three transmembrane domains 
(M1, M3, and M4) as well as the reentrant pore forming loop are involved in the 
gating. Among these regions, the second transmembrane domain is thought to be an 
important component of channel gating, since activation of the channel causes this 
domain to move. Within this domain, there is a highly conserved nine amino acids 
motif (SYTANLAAF). Site-directed mutagenesis of residues on this motif signifi-
cantly alters the channel function (8, 62, 85). The NMDA receptor second trans-
membrane domain is presumably a rigid helix that physically contacts the reentrant 
domain of both subunits moves during the gating, which directly results in the 
movement of the pore forming loop, and in turn, the channel pore. The narrowest 
constriction within the channel pore, which consists of the reentrant loop tip, might 
thus control opening or closing of the pore. 
 
The first widely accepted kinetic model for NMDA receptor activation was pro-
posed by Lester and Jahr (82) (Fig. 3a). This model consists of two independent but 
identical glutamate binding sites, one open state, one closed state, and one desensi-
tized state. This simple model describes the macroscopic time course for NMDA 
responses remarkably well, although it does not capture the complexity seen in single 
channel records. This model predicts the response with two decay phases of the 
EPSC and thus accounts for the synaptic response (82). There are several limitations

Fig. 3. Kinetic models for NMDA receptor activation. (a) Scheme 1: The first widely accepted 
kinetic model for NMDA receptor activation proposed by Lester and Jahr (82). This model 
consists of two independent but identical glutamate binding sites, one open state (A2R*), one 
closed state (A2R), and one desensitized state (A2RD). Glutamate binding is described by the 
agonist (A) binding, while all glycine binding sites are assumed to be fully occupied. This

although it does not capture the complexity seen in single channel records. (b) Scheme 2: The

occur in either order to arrive at the A2Rsf state that is then followed by channel opening. This 
multi-state gating model reconciled microscopic and macroscopic properties of channel func-
tion, and provides an example of how different subunits within the same receptor complex can

for channel activation. To overcome these limitations, newer models, which incorpo-
rate both glutamate and glycine binding steps, have been proposed (11, 83, 100). 
 
A key feature of several recently published conceptual models of function that 
provide a better description of single channel data is the incorporation of multiple 
steps between binding and gating (7, 41, 112, 114, 123). A recent study of single 
channel and macroscopic responses to full and partial agonists on recombinant 
NR1/NR2B receptors (7) suggested that agonist binding to different subunits in some 
fashion controls different steps in the receptor activation scheme, suggesting a work-
ing hypothesis that the binding of glutamate and glycine on separate subunits con-
trols different, perhaps subunit specific, conformational changes that are required for 
channel opening (Fig. 3b). These conformational changes are hypothesized to occur 
in either order to arrive at an intermediate state that is then followed by channel 
opening. Similar models have been proposed by Schorge et al. (123) and Auerbach 
and Zhou (4). A number of additional models (39, 113) can also account for micro-
scopic and macroscopic properties by incorporating multiple gating steps in a linear 
reaction scheme in which a specific sequence of transitions is implicit in the reaction 
mechanism. An important point made by all of these studies is that faithful represen-
tation of single channel data as well as macroscopic responses requires multiple pre-
gating steps as well as multiple open states (Fig. 3c). 
3.2 Structural Determinants of Ion Permeation 
The channel pore of NMDA receptors consists of an outer extracellular vestibule, an 
inner intracellular vestibule and a narrow constriction, which likely lies just past the 
midpoint traversing the membrane from extra- to intracellular. The extracellular 
vestibule is formed by the residues on the N-terminal side of the first transmembrane 
domain segment, the C-terminal portion of the second transmembrane domain, and 
the N-terminal portion of the third transmembrane domain of both NR1 and NR2 
subunits. In NR1/NR2 receptors, both NR1 and NR2 subunits contribute to the ex-
tracellular vestibule; the contribution of NR1 and NR2 may be staggered by one 
helical turn in the vertical axis perpendicular to the plane of the membrane (130). 
The second transmembrane domain of NR1 and NR2 appears to be the only trans-
membrane helix that contributes to the deep voltage-dependent portion of the vesti-
bule (129). The re-entrant pore-forming loop lines an intracellular vestibule with the 
tip of the loop forming the narrowest constriction of the channel. Both extracellular 
and intracellular vestibules are thought to be water-filled (8, 76). The narrow con-
striction, which may act as a molecular sieve, is referred to as the selectivity filter, 
and is typically a major determinant of ion selectivity in channels. By using the rela-
tive permeability of differently sized organic cations as an indicator of the dimension 
of the narrow constriction, the cross-sectional diameter of the narrow constriction of 
wild type recombinant NR1/NR2A receptor was suggested to be approximately 0.55 
nm (142). 
 
An accumulating body of evidence suggests that ionotropic glutamate receptors 
and potassium channels share a common architecture in their transmembrane pores. 
Sequence comparison, topology profiling, and analogy to a bacterial glutamate-
to this model, such as the disregard of the glycine binding steps, which are important"

activated receptor with a potassium-selective channel pore (92) provides compelling 
evidence for structural similarity between glutamate receptors and potassium chan-
nels. The primary differences in the pore-forming region between potassium chan-
nels and glutamate receptors is the orientation of the pore loop relative to the mem-
brane as well as the lack of a selectivity filter for NMDA receptors; NMDA 
receptors are permeable to Na+, K+, Ca2+, whereas potassium channels are selectively 
face the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, whereas both ends in potassium channels 
such as KcsA face the extracellular side. The structures of the KcsA and MthK chan-
nels have created a template for understanding glutamate receptor transmembane 
structure (33, 57). 
 
One feature that distinguishes NMDA receptors from other ligand gated channels 
is their unique subconductance levels and permeability to Ca2+. Multi-sublevel con-
ductance of NMDA receptors has been observed not only on recombinant NMDA 
receptors, but also in native neurons. The unitary conductance roughly correlates 
with Ca2+ permeability among NMDA receptors containing different NR2 subunits. 
In contrast to studies of AMPA receptors (117, 128), the frequency of subconduc-
tance level transitions in NMDA receptors are concentration-independent. The chan-
nel of NMDA receptors is more selective for Ca2+ than for monovalent ions such as 
Na+ and K+. The NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx not only alters intracellular 
Ca2+ concentration, but also triggers many biological functions, such as changes in 
synaptic efficacy, gene expression, development of synaptic connections, as well as 
pathological processes. A number of lines of investigation suggest that the apex of 
the reentrant pore forming loop reaches towards the extracellular vestibule and forms 
the narrow region, which contributes to the ion selectivity (153). Several residues 
that determine the ion permeability have been identified (15, 55, 66, 126). The same 
asparagine residue in the pore forming reentrant loop of both NR1 and NR2 subunits 
that plays a key role in Mg2+ block also is involved in the Ca2+ permeation (15). This 
residue is analogous to the Q/R-site in AMPA receptors, which also controls Ca2+ 
permeation. 
3.3 Structural Determinants of Channel Block 
One unique feature of NMDA receptors is their voltage-dependent channel block by 
extracellular Mg2+. Both native and recombinant NMDA receptors show a strong 
voltage-dependent block by physiological concentrations of Mg2+, which acts to 
prevent influx of Ca2+ and monovalent cations. This Mg2+ blockade is relieved by the 
depolarization of the membrane potential, providing the receptor with the ability to 
detect coincident release of glutamate and postsynaptic membrane depolarization. If 
the membrane potential is sufficiently depolarized to relieve voltage-dependent 
channel block by extracellular Mg2+ at the time NMDA receptors bind glutamate and 
glycine, the channel will open and allow ion permeation that can lead to a significant 
influx of Ca2+. This in turn will trigger a series of intracellular events under both 
physiological and pathophysiological conditions that can alter the strength of synap-
tic signaling. The degree of the Mg2+ blockade is different on the different NR2-
containing NMDA receptors. NR2A- and NR2B-subunit containing NMDA recep-

tors are more sensitive to Mg2+ block than the NR2C- and NR2D-subunit containing 
NMDA receptors. In addition, NR2A- and NR2B-containing receptors exhibit a 
slower component of Mg2+ unblock than NR2C- and NR2D-containing receptors 
(29). 
 
Although the structural determinants of Mg2+ block are becoming clearer, more 
information is still needed before a specific model of Mg2+ block at atomic resolution 
can be proposed. An N-site asparagine has been located as a key determinant of 
Mg2+ block. Several mutagenesis studies suggest that channels containing amino acid 
substitutions at the N-site or adjacent asparagines in the NR2A subunit show an 
increased Mg2+ permeability, suggesting that these adjacent asparagine residues form 
a barrier for inward Mg2+ influx (152). Other than the N-site asparagines, several 
additional regions for blockade by Mg2+ have been identified. Studies of chimeric 
receptors suggest that multiple structural elements control the NR2 subunit specific-
ity of Mg2+ block, including the first transmembrane domain, the small linker con-
necting pore forming reentrant loop and the second transmembrane domain, and the 
third transmembrane domain (74). 
 
Besides external Mg2+, a number of other rigid organic cations of diverse chemi-
cal structures are capable of blocking the NMDA pore when the channel opens. Most 
of these compounds are positively charged at physiological pH and function as un-
competitive inhibitors. A defining property of these channel blockers is that they 
bind to and block agonist-gated open channels more rapidly than the closed channels, 
a feature termed use-dependence. Based on the difference in the interaction with the 
channel gate, the open channel blockers are further classified into three categories: 
(1) trapping blockers, such as MK-801, phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine, which 
unbinds; (2) “sequential” or “foot-in-the-door” blockers, such as aminoacridine de-
rivatives and tetraetylammonium (TEA), which bind to the channel only when it is 
open and prevent channel closure; (3) partial trapping blockers, such as memantine 
 
Numerous studies show that NMDA channel blockers are neuroprotective in 
animal models of neurological disorders that involve excessive stimulation of the 
NMDA receptors, such as traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, stroke, neuropathic pain, 
as well as neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson’s 
disease and Huntington’s disease. However, clinical trials have largely been disap-
pointing, as dose-limiting side effects and a narrow temporal window for interven-
tion have likely confounded interpretation and derailed positive results. Interestingly, 
low affinity channel blockers are well tolerated, and memantine, which shows fast 
blocking/unblocking kinetics, has been approved for clinical use in the United States 
for treating Alzheimer’s disease (84). With more attention to subunit selectivity, 
rapid block and unblock kinetics, additional channel blockers may show promise as 
clinically useful agents. 
 
are trapped inside the pore as the channel returns to the closed state and the agonist 
and amantadine, which exhibit intermediate properties between above two categories, 
impede the channel closure without completely preventing it."

4 Regulation of NMDA Receptor Function 
NMDA receptors are regulated by phosphorylation, extracellular ions, and intracellu-
lar binding proteins. We will focus primarily on regulation of NMDA receptor func-
tion by extracellular ions and molecules, with particular attention given to mecha-
nisms for which structural information exists. 
4.1 Desensitization of NMDA Receptors 
Desensitization is operational defined as a decrement in receptor response in the 
continued presence of a stimulus. Native and recombinant NMDA receptors desensi-
tize by several different mechanisms, including glycine-dependent desensitization, 
Zn2+-dependent desensitization, Ca2+ dependent desensitization, and glycine/Ca2+/ 
Zn2+-independent desensitization. We will consider each in turn. 
 
Mayer and colleagues (93) were the first to describe an apparent desensitization 
of neuronal NMDA receptors in the presence of sub-saturating glycine concentration, 
which abated with increases in the concentration of extracellular glycine. They pos-
tulated that a negative allosteric interaction occurred between the glutamate- and 
glycine binding domains such that the binding of glutamate decreased the affinity for 
glycine (10, 83). The idea embodied in this working hypothesis was simple—when 
glutamate binds, the affinity for the glycine binding site becomes lower, and in the 
absence of high concentrations of glycine, the current diminishes with the relaxation 
to a new equilibrium as glycine unbinds from the receptor. Since glycine is a re-
quired co-agonist of the NMDA receptor, sub-saturating concentrations of glycine 
results in a desensitization of the current. The time course for the desensitization thus 
reflects the unbinding of glycine from the receptor, and is within the range of synap-
tic NMDA receptor time course, suggesting it could impact synaptic signaling. While 
this mechanism was proposed purely from functional data, subsequent structural 
studies (47) showed that the glycine binding domain of the NR1 subunit crystallizes 
as a heterodimer with the glutamate binding domain of NR2, providing a plausible 
structural model for negative allosteric coupling between the glutamate and glycine 
binding sites. 
 
Extracellular Zn2+ has long been known to inhibit neuronal NMDA receptors 
(110, 146). A number of investigators have reported high affinity regulation of 
NR2A-containing recombinant NMDA receptors by nanomolar concentrations of 
extracellular Zn2+ (20, 104, 137, 150). However, Raymond and colleagues observed 
the appearance of a rapid component of desensitization in the presence of extracellu-
lar Zn2+, and postulated that Zn2+ accelerated receptor desensitization (20). Subse-
quent work showed that Zn2+-induced desensitization occurred by a similar mecha-
nism as glycine-dependent desensitization. Zheng et al. (159) proposed that a 
positive allosteric intra-subunit interaction exists between the glutamate binding 
domain and the Zn2+ binding domain, which likely resides in the NR2A amino ter-
minal domain (26, 45, 86, 106). The working hypothesis, supported by a range of 
experimentation, suggests that binding of glutamate enhances Zn2+ binding, such that 
in the presence of subsaturating concentrations of Zn2+, the system relaxes to a new 
equilibrium with Zn2+ binding to the receptor in a concentration-dependent fashion."

H. Yuan et al. 
 
Thus, the desensitization time course reflects the time course for Zn2+ binding to the 
receptors following a shift of the Zn2+ binding site into a high affinity state (42). 
 
NMDA receptors additionally undergo a Ca2+-dependent inhibition that is propor-
tional to the magnitude of the current, and is often referred to as Ca2+ dependent 
desensitization or inactivation (28, 80, 116, 143). Ca2+-dependent desensitization 
develops slowly over seconds, and can be blocked by introduction of Ca2+ chelators 
into the cell. The magnitude of Ca2+-dependent desensitization varies among NR2 
subunits, being more prominent for NR2A than for NR2D, and absent for NR2B and 
NR2C receptors (72, 95). The working hypothesis underlying this form of regulation 
is that an increase in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ occurs in the immediate 
vicinity of the intracellular portion of the channel, and this increased Ca2+ inhibits the 
receptor by stimulating the uncoupling of the receptor from filamentous actin in a 
manner sensitive to second messenger systems (118). Additional data suggest a role 
for calmodulin binding to the NR1 subunit of the receptor in this form of desensitiza-
tion. NR1 splice variants can remove one of a pair of calmodulin binding sites from 
the receptor and abolish Ca2+-dependent desensitization (37, 38). Furthermore, muta-
tions within one of these NR1 calmodulin binding sites disrupt Ca2+-dependent de-
sensitization (73, 158). Interestingly, alpha-actinin2 binds to the intracellular C-
terminal of the NR1 subunit in a manner that is antagonized by calmodulin (2, 156), 
suggesting alpha-actinin2 may be involved in Ca2+-dependent desensitization. 
 
A wide range of ligand-gated channels undergo a form of desensitization that 
appears to reflect conformational changes within the receptor. Independent of the 
forms of desensitization discussed above, the NMDA receptor can additional desen-
sitize in the continued presence of agonist by a mechanism that is independent of 
Ca2+, Zn2+ and glycine; such desensitization is more prominent in excised outside-out 
membrane patches, suggesting a regulation by a diffusible factor (121, 122). This 
form of desensitization can be reduced by mutations both in the conserved 
SYTANLAAF motif in the second transmembrane domain and deep within the 
channel pore, suggesting that it may be coupled to the gating mechanism (19, 53). 
Interestingly, glycine and Ca2+-independent desensitization of certain subunits are 
also controlled by the presence of CamKII, which accelerates the rate of desensitiza-
(125). 
4.2 Allosteric Regulation of NMDA Receptor Function by Protons 
sensitivity (reviewed by (136)), NMDA receptors appeared somewhat unique in that 
protons potently (IC50 50 nM) and completely inhibited receptor function with a 
concentration-effect relationship that approximately followed a single binding site 
isotherm. These reports suggested that neuronal NMDA receptors are tonically inhib-
ited by physiological concentrations of protons with an IC50 value that corresponds 
to about pH 7.4, or approximately 50 nM protons. Proton inhibition depends on 
alternative RNA splicing of the NR1 subunit and the identity of the NR2 subunit 
(140). Under physiological conditions, the NMDA receptor resides under tonic inhi-
tion of NR1/NR2B, but slows the rate of desensitization of NR1/NR2A receptors 
A number of studies have described inhibition of NMDA receptors by extracellular 
protons (49, 134, 139, 144). Although virtually all receptors show some form of pH"

bition, and can respond to small changes in extracellular pH, which is dynamic and 
function (5, 24, 25, 101, 127). 
 
A number of experiments all show that extracellular (but not intracellular) pro-
tons act in a voltage-independent manner that is also independent of actions at the 
agonist binding site. At the single channel level, protons appear to reduce open prob-
ability for NR1/NR2B recombinant receptors, with only modest effects on the open 
time and no effects on single channel conductance (6, 138). Mutagenesis data, while 
not implicating any single residue as causative for proton inhibition, shows a cluster-
ing of residues at which mutagenesis alters pH sensitivity that is near the linkers 
coupling the agonist binding domain to the transmembrane helices (85). Interest-
ingly, inward rectifier potassium channels, which share a number of common fea-
tures with the glutamate receptor family (75), are also pH sensitive (e.g. (124)), rais-
ing the possibility that the two channels share some structural determinants or 
mechanisms of proton inhibition. 
 
Several recent studies suggest that the downstream effects of a number of modu-
lators may reflect a subtle change in the pKa of the proton sensor that either en-
hances or reduces tonic proton inhibition at physiological pH; enhancement of proton 
sensitivity will appear as inhibition, whereas a reduction in sensitivity to protons 
appears as a potentiation. For example, regulation of NMDA receptor function by 
extracellular polyamines such as spermine (61, 148) occurs in a subunit-dependent 
fashion, with only the NR2B subunit showing potentiation by 100’s of micromolar 
spermine (35, 36). The potentiation by polyamines only occurs at pH values that 
produce tonic inhibition, suggesting that the binding of polyamines such as spermine 
shifts the pKa of the proton sensor to reduce tonic inhibition. Consistent with this 
idea, spermine can shift the experimentally-determined proton inhibition curve, and 
there is a strong correlation between the degree of proton inhibition and the degree of 
spermine potentiation, consistent with a relief of proton inhibition by polyamines 
(140). There is also a strong correlation between the ability of various mutations to 
shift the proton sensitivity and their effects on polyamine potentiation (64, 65, 89, 
140, 151). These data all suggest that the full potentiating effect of polyamine bind-
ing (in the presence of saturating glutamate and glycine) can be accounted for by 
relief of tonic proton inhibition. This finding created two important precedents. First, 
this conclusion (spermine relieves proton inhibition by shifting the pKa of a proton 
sensor; (140)) established the idea that exogenous molecules could regulate NMDA 
receptor function through actions on the proton sensor. Second, implicit in this straight-
forward mechanism is the idea that agents that enhance or diminish proton sensitivity 
can cause inhibition and potentiation of NMDA receptor function, respectively. 
4.3 Allosteric Regulation of NMDA Receptor Function  
The isolation of cDNA’s encoding the NMDA receptor subunits in the 1990’s pro-
vided an opportunity to pursue a molecular understanding of Zn2+ inhibition. One of 
the first observations made was that the NR2A subunit was exquisitely sensitive to 
changes with neuronal activity (24). Changes in pH driven by pathological situations, 
such as seizure or ischemia, are also more than sufficient to inhibit NMDA receptor 
by Extracellular Zn2+"

extracellular Zn2+, with variable IC50 values reported in the nM range (e.g. (20, 
147)). Paoletti et al. (104) used buffered Zn2+ to unambiguously determine the IC50 
value for the high affinity Zn2+ site, and further showed that hundreds of nanomolar 
Zn2+ often persists as a contaminant of physiological saline solutions made from 
commercially available salts. One interesting feature to emerge from these studies is 
that Zn2+ inhibition curves for NR1/NR2A receptors are biphasic. The interpretation 
of this was that saturating concentrations of Zn2+ at the nM high affinity site do not 
impart full inhibition, which could only be observed at higher concentrations of Zn2+ 
(10’s of micromolar), which cause a voltage-dependent channel block. Studies of 
chimeric NR2A-NR2C receptors suggested that the amino terminal domain of NR2A 
controlled the high affinity Zn2+ site (45). Site-directed mutagenesis further isolated a 
series of histidine residues that were candidates for chelating Zn2+ within its binding 
site (26, 45, 86). The amino terminal domain harboring the Zn2+ site shows a number 
of similarities to both bacterial periplasmic amino acid binding proteins as well as 
the glutamate binding site of mGluR1, allowing structural models of amino terminal 
domain to be developed (105). These models and supporting experimentation show 
convincingly that the amino terminal domain folds into a bi-lobed clamshell struc-
ture, with the Zn2+ binding site residing within the cleft. 
 
Following work on ifenprodil ((99), see below) and spermine control of NMDA 
receptor proton sensitivity of receptors (140), Choi and Lipton (26) proposed that the 
binding of extracellular Zn2+ to the amino terminal domain enhances the sensitivity 
of the NR1/NR2A receptor to protons. The leftward shift of the proton inhibition 
curve for Zn2+-bound receptors means that at pH 7.4, the extent of inhibition by 
protons increases from 50% to perhaps 80%. The result of this is an apparent Zn2+-
induced inhibition that reflects an increase in the proportion of protonated and non-
functional receptors. A number of lines of evidence support this hypothesis. At alka-
line pH values where the proton inhibition is absent, Zn2+ causes no inhibition.  
Furthermore, the close functional interactions of Zn2+ binding and proton inhibition 
implies a strong correlation between the ability of mutations to shift the proton sensi-
tivity and their effects on the Zn2+ inhibition (86). Lastly, kinetic modeling of Zn2+-
induced enhancement of proton inhibition can quantitatively account for the actions 
of Zn2+on proton binding rates, providing additional support to this hypothesis (43). 
 
Zn2+ inhibits the NR2B-containing NMDA receptors with an IC50 value near 1 
micromolar. Rachline et al. (115) have recently extended the structural hypothesis 
developed for Zn2+ inhibition at NR2A to the NR2B subunit. Their ideas are consis-
tent with functional model of inhibition originally proposed by Choi & Lipton (26) 
for Zn2+ inhibition of both NR2A and NR2B containing receptors. This idea is also 
consistent with mutagenesis studies showing similar sensitivity to mutations of Zn2+ 
and proton IC50 values (137). Interestingly, the high affinity Zn2+site is partially 
maintained in heterotrimeric NR1/NR2A/NR2B receptors, but shows shallower 
inhibition (51). 
4.4 NR2B Selective Allosteric Modulators 
The phenylethanolamine ifenprodil was the first subunit-selective antagonist identi-
fied at any NMDA receptor subunit (149). Characterization of this compound and a"

host of analogues (67) have provided an invaluable set of tools for dissecting the 
functional role of the NR2B subunit in a range of neurophysiological, developmen-
tal, and pathological situations. Most data support the idea that ifenprodil binds to the 
amino terminal domain of an NR2B subunit in a fashion analogous to Zn2+ binding 
to NR2A (14, 48, 109, 154), although residues in the NR1 amino terminal domain 
also have important effects on ifenprodil binding (89). Molecular modeling studies 
support an intra-cleft binding site within the NR2B bi-lobed amino terminal domain 
(54, 88, 109), analogous to that proposed for Zn2+ binding to the NR2A amino termi-
nal domain. In addition, ifenprodil and its analogues exert a range of actions includ-
ing a positive allosteric enhancement of submaximal glutamate responses (68, 69). 
At higher concentrations, ifenprodil induces a non-competitive, voltage-independent 
inhibition of NR1/NR2B receptors that is incomplete. Extensive studies of the 
mechanism suggest ifenprodil promotes entry of the receptor into a long-lived shut 
state that is analogous to desensitization (68, 69). A large number of structural 
classes of NR2B-selective ligands have been described, which show a surprising 
degree of diversity in structure (12, 17, 23, 79). 
 
Mott et al. (99) have proposed that ifenprodil binding causes a unique action on 
the proton sensor, which enhances the proton sensitivity of the receptor. Evaluation 
of the proton inhibition curve in the absence and presence of ifenprodil shows a 
leftward shift, with ifenprodil enhancing proton inhibition of receptor function at all 
pH values except alkaline levels. This enhancement of proton sensitivity increases 
the level of tonic inhibition at physiological pH, which appears as inhibition. The 
potency of ifenprodil is pH sensitive, and there is a strong correlation with the po-
tency shift induced in ifenprodil and proton sensitivity by a series of mutants (99, 
103). Perhaps the strongest evidence supporting the idea of enhancement of proton 
sensitivity by ifenprodil comes from experiments at alkaline pH values where there 
is little proton inhibition; under this condition there is no effect of ifenprodil even 
though it remains bound to the receptor. These data provide a link between mecha-
nisms of regulation by ligands of the amino terminal domain, and also suggest that 
the tight regulation of gating by protons could be a downstream substrate for several 
regulatory pathways. 
5 Conclusions 
The remarkable advances in our understanding of all features of the NMDA recep-
tors suggest that their modular receptor design impacts function and regulation. That 
is, autonomous domains have clear and distinct effects on receptor function. It is also 
clear that key features of receptor structure are conserved across the glutamate recep-
tor family, although different subunit families appear to have perhaps somewhat 
different mechanisms of activation and desensitization. What seems clear is that the 
first steps of channel activation are similar between AMPA, kainate and NMDA 
receptors, which all presumably undergo agonist-induced domain closure. After this 
point, it remains unclear how the similar molecular themes of conformational 
changes in the ligand binding domain, stability of the dimer interface, and intra-
subunit conformational changes shared in all families work to provide unique activa-"

tion mechanisms. Reconciling the structural features with gating mechanisms will be 
an important step forward in advancing understanding of gating. In addition, differ-
ences between subunits impact their pharmacology and function, providing a wide 
range of properties that can be utilized by cells for different functions at different 
times. Understanding the molecular basis of receptor pharmacology will provide 
further insight into receptor function. Moreover, the various autonomous domains 
provide a host of therapeutic targets, and the best tolerated NMDA receptor antago-
nists so far are subunit-selective allosteric modulators. It seems highly likely that as 
additional efforts are focused on modulation, more subunit selective modulators will 
emerge for clinical evaluation.

Abstract. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) play a distinct role at excitatory glutamatergic syn-
apses, where they are usually localized with other ionotropic glutamate receptors, including 
tors. Two features are essential to their specialized roles in synaptic plasticity and the excito-
dependent magnesium block, the removal of which requires depolarization of the membrane 
potential. Second, upon activation, the NMDAR channel passes sodium and, importantly, 
calcium into the neuron. Calcium is the universal second messenger in numerous intracellular 
signaling cascades and is critical in synaptic plasticity and mechanisms of neurotoxicity (288). 
1 NMDAR Structure and Subunits 
The functional NMDAR is a tetrameric protein complex with subunits comprised of 
three gene families: NR1, NR2, and NR3. All NMDAR subunits have similar mem-
brane topology: an extracellular amino-terminal domain (ATD), 3 transmembrane 
domains (TM1, 3, 4), a re-entrant P loop at TM2 that lines the pore of the channel, 
and an intracellular C-terminal tail. The ATD is implicated in subunit assembly (210, 
213) and in receptor sensitivity to modulators such as protons, polyamines, Zn2+, and 
ifenprodil (76, 198, 256) (for review, see (122)). The extracellular S1 (N-terminal) 
and S2 (between TM3 and TM4) regions comprise the glycine-binding domains of 
NR1 (124, 162, 350) and NR3 (10, 40), and the glutamate-binding domains of the 
NR2 subunits (172, 318). The intracellular C-terminal tail, the sequence and length 
of which varies considerably among the different subunits, interacts with numerous 
binding partners (252, 364) and contains multiple phosphorylation sites (145, 283, 
364). 
 
NR1 subunits contain three alternatively spliced exons- one near the N-terminus 
(N1; exon 5) and two in the C-terminal tail (C1 and C2/C2’; exons 21 and 22). Thus, 
there are eight different splice forms, seven of which have been identified in vivo 
(174), that exhibit distinct regional distributions over development (175, 269, 392).

Fig. 2. Summary of NMDAR trafficking at the synapse in mature forebrain. NMDARs are 
clustered at the postsynaptic membrane. Their presence in this region is regulated by interac-
tions with PDZ proteins and adhesion molecules that can serve as scaffolds to bring them into 
contact with signaling and regulatory proteins (see sections on interacting proteins). The num-
ber of NMDARs at the synapse can also be modulated by their addition or removal from the 
synaptic membrane (see Section 4.1.1). To be internalized, NMDARs move to an endocytic 
zone located in the perisynaptic membrane to undergo clathrin-dependent endocytosis. 
NMDARs may also be internalized by a clathrin-independent pathway, although this mecha-
nism is not well defined. The insertion of newly synthesized or recycled NMDARs may occur 
in the endocytic zone or the postsynaptic density. In addition, mobile pools of NMDARs may 
diffuse laterally between the extrasynaptic and synaptic membranes (see Section 5). Down-
stream signaling of extrasynaptic and synaptic NMDARs may differ, resulting in deactivation 
or activation, respectively, of CREB and BDNF. 
the olfactory system requires NMDAR activation and enhances the expression of 
NR2A-containing receptors relative to NR2B-containing receptors in the piriform 
cortex (270). However, there also may be regional differences in the mechanisms of 
synaptic insertion for NR2A- and NR2B-containing receptors. In hippocampal slices 
prepared from rats at P6-7 and cultured for approximately 2.5 days, the insertion of 
NR2B-containing receptors does not change the kinetics of synaptic NMDARs (12), 
whereas the insertion of NR2A-containing receptors induces a faster decay time (12, 
272). This suggests that both are replacing pre-existing NR2B-containing receptors. 
In contrast, in cerebellar granule cells harvested at P6 and cultured for 6-8 DIV, 
overexpression of NR2B slows the decay of NMDAR-mediated currents and over-"

expression of NR2A quickens their kinetics (268), indicating that both types of 
NMDARs can replace the other form.  
 
The mechanism that determines the number of synaptic NMDARs is unknown, 
although it appears to be distinct from the mechanism regulating extrasynaptic recep-
tors. In cultured cerebellar granule cells, overexpression of NR2A or NR2B subunits 
causes an increase in the total number of functional NMDARs, whereas overexpres-
sion of the NR1 subunit does not (268). However, overexpression of NR2 subunits 
does not change the number of synaptic receptors, indicating that synaptic receptors 
are not regulated solely by availability. On the other hand, extrasynaptic receptors 
appear to be determined, at least to some extent, by the number of receptors synthe-
sized. It is important, however, to point out that this latter property may vary among 
different neuron types. 
 
 
 
The removal of synaptic receptors likely requires at least three stages. First, the 
receptor is released from its anchor that holds it at the synapse. Second, for clathrin-
dependent internalization, the receptor moves in the plasma membrane to the edge of 
the synapse either by diffusion or some form of active transport (see Section 5). 
Finally, the receptor is removed from the plasma membrane. Most current evidence 
shows that NMDARs are endocytosed through a clathrin-dependent mechanism 
(176, 237, 258, 279, 348). For clathrin-dependent internalization from the plasma 
membrane, proteins often contain an endocytic motif that is recognized by the AP-2 
adaptor complex. Interestingly, NR2A and NR2B subunits use different motifs for 
removal. The NR2B subunit has a tyrosine-based YXXФ consensus motif, YEKL, 
near its C-terminus that can bind to AP-2 and promote clathrin-dependent internali-
zation (279). In contrast, a homologous tyrosine-based YKKM motif on the NR2A 
subunit is not involved with NMDAR endocytosis, but rather, a dileucine motif (LL), 
which also binds to the AP-2 complex, is involved in endocytosis of NR2A subunits 
(176). Another YXXФ consensus motif of the NR2A subunit near its last transmem-
brane domain binds to AP-2 and leads to use-dependent rundown of NMDAR cur-
rent (348). In fact, tyrosine-containing motifs present near the last transmembrane 
domain of all NR2 subunits are involved in NMDAR internalization and may target 
NMDARs to late endosomes for degradation (294). Therefore, multiple sites on the 
C-termini of both NR1 and NR2 subunits are involved in endocytosis of NMDARs, 
and additional sites are likely to be identified. 
 
Recent evidence suggests that NMDARs may also be removed by nonclathrin-
mediated pathways. For instance, prolonged activation of NMDARs leads to their 
degradation by calpain in a process that is not dependent on clathrin-mediated endo-
cytosis (371). In clathrin-independent pathways, endocytosis occurs via uncoated 
invaginations in lipid rafts (149, 234), microdomains of the membrane proposed to 
act as platforms for neurotransmitter signaling (5). Although little is known about 
clathrin-independent internalization of NMDARs, it may occur in concert with 
clathrin-mediated pathways. Similar to the paradigm for internalization of epidermal 
growth factor receptors (302), higher levels of glutamate in the synapse may trigger 
clathrin-independent removal of NMDARs. The site of clathrin-independent endocy-
tosis is undefined."

Once NMDARs are removed from the synaptic membrane, the intracellular 
pathways of NR2A- and NR2B-containing receptors diverge. Both encounter early 
endosomes, but then most NR2B-containing receptors are sent to recycling en-
dosomes, whereas most NR2A-containing receptors travel to late endosomes (176). 
This implies that although NR2B-containing receptors are endocytosed more readily 
than NR2A-containing receptors (176), they are more likely to recycle and return to 
the synapse. 
4.1.2 Modification of NMDARs by Phosphorylation  
Members of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) family include Src, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, 
and Yes. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on NR2A and NR2B subunits potenti-
ates NMDAR-mediated currents (357). Tyrosine residues exist on NR2A and NR2B 
subunits (283). The YEKL internalization motif on the NR2B subunit discussed 
above contains the tyrosine residue Tyr1472 that is a major substrate for Fyn kinase 
(231). In cerebellar granule cells, phosphorylation of this residue by Fyn increases 
the synaptic localization of NMDARs by preventing their internalization (267). Also, 
in striatal tissue of Fyn knockout mice, basal tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and 
NR2B is reduced and NMDARs fail to redistribute to the synapse upon stimulation 
of dopamine receptors (72). 
 
Calcium influx through NMDARs generates the production of cyclic AMP, 
which activates cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA can phosphory-
late NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits. This phosphorylation can increase NMDAR 
activity by promoting synaptic targeting (54) or enhancing calcium permeability of 
NMDARs (305). PKA also can associate indirectly with NMDARs via Yotiao, al-
lowing it to overcome the constitutive activity of protein phosphatase 1 (366). In 
addition, PKA can have indirect effects on NMDARs, such as in its phosphorylation 
of the immediate early gene cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), 
which can then activate other signaling cascades such as the MAP kinase pathway or 
induce new protein synthesis (352). Due to its calcium-dependent role, PKA is im-
portant for the induction of LTP and spatial long-term memory (1). 
 
Protein kinase C (PKC) also phosphorylates NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits. 
PKC activation increases the amplitude of NMDAR-mediated currents and channel 
open probability (43, 101, 374), in part by increasing the number of NMDARs in-
serted into the synaptic membrane (167). However, these enhancements are probably 
due to indirect signaling through second messenger cascades (390). Direct phos-
phorylation of NMDARs by PKC induces rapid dispersal of NMDARs from the 
synaptic to extrasynaptic membrane (87, 329) and increases their sensitivity to inac-
tivation by intracellular Ca2+ (202). 
 
Activation of casein kinase II (CKII) potentiates NMDAR activity by prolonging 
channel open time (187) and may contribute to the induction of LTP (39). CKII may 
also facilitate the replacement of NR2B-containing receptors with NR2A-containing 
receptors because it phosphorylates serine residue Ser1480 in the PDZ binding do-
main of the NR2B subunit, thereby blocking the interaction of NR2B-containing 
receptors with PDZ proteins and decreasing their surface expression in an activity-
dependent manner (49)."

Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylates NR2A subunits at serine resi-
due Ser1232 (184). This modification is important for mediating NMDA-evoked 
synaptic currents during the induction of LTP (184), as well as ischemic degenera-
tion of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (355). 
4.1.3 Other Modifications  
Ubiquitin conjugation involves the sequential actions of ubiquitin-activating en-
zymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3) (362). 
The E3 ubiquitin ligase confers protein specificity, in part by forming a complex 
with F-box proteins. Many postsynaptic proteins undergo ubiquitination and subse-
quent degradation by proteasomes, and this process may be dependent on neuronal 
activity (78). It is unclear whether NMDARs undergo ubiquitination. In synapto-
somal membranes from cortical neurons, ubiquitination of the NR1, NR2A, and 
NR2B subunits was not detectable (78). However, in a separate study, expression 
cloning identified F-box protein 2 (Fbx2) as an interactor of the NR1 subunit (143). 
Fbx2 was shown to induce the ubiquitination of the NR1 subunit in HEK293T cells 
through binding to high-mannose glycans on the extracellular domain of the NR1 
subunit. Interestingly, effects of Fbx2 inhibition on NMDAR ubiquitination were 
only observed under conditions of enhanced neuronal activity (143). 
 
NMDARs are also modified by S-nitrosylation of cysteines of the NR2A subunit 
by nitric oxide, which can down regulate ion channel activity (47). 
4.1.4 Interactions with PDZ Proteins  
NMDARs can bind to the PDZ domains of all MAGUKs (156, 171, 235). MAGUKs 
are abundant at all excitatory synapses, although their expression varies during de-
velopment. In the hippocampus, the expression of SAP102 peaks during early devel-
opment whereas the expressions of PSD-95 and PSD-93 are highest during adult-
hood (82, 287). This parallels the developmental shift from NR2B-containing 
receptors to NR2A-containing receptors at synapses, suggesting that SAP102 may 
preferentially bind to NR2B-containing receptors and PSD-95 and PSD-93 may 
selectively bind to NR2A-containing receptors (287, 336). 
 
MAGUKs may function as anchors that retain and cluster proteins such as 
NMDARs at a particular cellular location. Studies on animal models have shown that 
the NR2 C-terminus is required for synaptic localization of NMDARs (312, 317). 
However, these results, in which nearly the entire C-terminus was deleted, could be 
due to the loss of other components of the C-terminus rather than only the PDZ bind-
ing domain. Studies using transfection of wild type and mutant NMDAR subunits 
 
Activity-dependent calcium influx induces autophosphorylation of Ca2+/ 
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), leading to its increased localiza-
tion at the postsynaptic density (67, 299). CaMKII can bind NR1, NR2A, or NR2B 
subunits (100, 180), although its interaction with NR2B-containing receptors is much 
stronger than with NR2A-containing receptors (320). The interaction of CaMKII and 
NR2B-containing receptors locks CaMKII in an active conformation (16), enabling it 
to phosphorylate AMPARs and mediate LTP (7, 13, 63)."

R.J. Wenthold et al. 
 
have shown that NR2B-containing receptors depend on the PDZ binding domain for 
entry/retention at the synapse (267), while NR2A-containing receptors do not (12, 
267, 327). Overexpression studies are conflicting, for in hippocampal neurons PSD-
95 overexpression does not affect the synaptic clustering or function of NMDARs 
(81, 290), although in cerebellar granule cells it does promote the synaptic insertion 
of NR2A-containing receptors (196). Knockout mice lacking PSD-95 (218) or PSD-
93 (208) have no significant loss of synaptic NMDARs. However, double knockout 
mice lacking both PSD-95 and PSD-93 show a reduction in NMDAR-mediated cur-
rents (82), indicating that compensatory mechanisms may stabilize NMDARs at 
 
MAGUKs also function as scaffolds that bring NMDARs into contact with regu-
latory and signaling molecules. For example, interactions with MAGUKs may in-
hibit internalization of NR2B-containing NMDARs by promoting the phosphoryla-
tion of Tyr1472 by Fyn kinase (72, 267), thus preventing the interaction of the NR2B 
subunit with AP-2 (see Section 4.1.1). Some proteins can be linked to NMDARs by 
binding to adjacent PDZ domains of MAGUKs. Examples include neuronal nitric 
oxide synthase (nNOS), which can mediate NMDAR-induced excitotoxicity (36), 
and synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein (SynGAP), which couples NMDARs to 
the MAP kinase pathway (148). Other proteins may be linked to NMDARs by 
guanylate kinase-associated protein (GKAP), a central molecule that binds to the GK 
domain of MAGUKs (146). For instance, GKAP binds to Shank, which binds to 
Homer dimers that then bind to various other proteins including metabotropic gluta-
mate receptors or IP3 receptors (230, 339). 
 
NMDARs are linked to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions (147) such as 
PSD-95-SPAR-actin, GKAP-Shank-cortactin-actin, or PSD-95-citron, which is a 
target of Rho (94). NMDARs can also associate with actin filaments via actinin 
(372) or α1-chimerin, an inhibitor of Rac1 (344). This suggests a mechanism for 
NMDAR activity to control overall spine structure (see Section 6.2). 
 
Other PDZ proteins that can also act as scaffolding molecules for NMDARs 
include synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM) (125) and channel interacting PDZ 
domain protein (CIPP) (161). CIPP is highly expressed in thalamus, colliculi, cere-
bellum, and brainstem, and can also bind to adhesion molecules (161). S-SCAM can 
link the MAP kinase pathway to NMDARs by binding to nRap GEP (neural 
GDP/GTP exchange protein for Rap1 small G-protein). S-SCAM (or PSD-95) also 
binds to membrane-associated guanylate kinase interacting protein (MAGUIN) 
(377), which may affect cell polarity (242). 
4.1.5 Interactions with Adhesion Molecules  
NMDARs interact directly and indirectly with a variety of adhesion molecules at the 
synapse, including some that act transynaptically to link NMDARs to the presynaptic 
terminal. Adhesion molecules play a role in the formation, maturation, function, and 
plasticity of synapses (56). Similar to PDZ proteins, one of their functions may be to 
synapses. NMDARs are less affected than AMPARs by changes in MAGUK expres-
sion. Acute knockdown studies using shRNA for PSD-95 show either no change in 
NMDARs while AMPARs decrease (82) or a moderate reduction in NMDA EPSCs 
(79)."

cluster NMDARs at synapses. Recent evidence suggests that PDZ proteins and adhe-
sion molecules work together (95, 278), perhaps in a compensatory manner. 
 
The binding of presynaptic ephrin-B to postsynaptic EphB receptors induces a 
direct interaction of EphB receptors with the extracellular domain of NR1 subunits 
(57) that enhances NMDAR-mediated synaptic function (108, 120). Activated EphB 
receptors also have tyrosine kinase activity that can indirectly potentiate NMDAR-
mediated Ca2+ influx (325) and lead to synapse formation (57). EphB is critical for 
the formation of the postsynaptic density and dendritic spines (121). 
 
A family of synaptic adhesion-like molecules (SALMs) was recently discovered 
on the basis of its interactions with MAGUKs (153, 353). Of the five members, 
SALMS1-3 have PDZ binding domains which could allow SALMs to be linked 
indirectly with NMDARs at the synapse. However, SALM1 can also bind directly to 
the extracellular domain of the NR1 subunit when expressed in heterologous cells 
(353). Although a presynaptic ligand has not yet been found, SALM1 and SALM2 
can induce synapse formation and neurite outgrowth (153, 353). 
 
Other families of transynaptic adhesion molecules may act indirectly to affect 
synaptic NMDARs ((56); see also the Section 6.1 below). Presynaptic neurexin binds 
to postsynaptic neuroligin, which interacts with the MAGUKs. Neuroligin localiza-
tion at synapses may help recruit NMDARs to synapses and determine if developing 
synapses become excitatory or inhibitory (182). Similarly, homophilic interactions 
between presynaptic and postsynaptic cadherins induce interaction with postsynaptic 
β-catenin, which can bind directly to the PDZ scaffold S-SCAM and may control its 
synaptic targeting (236). NrCAM binds directly to SAP102 (59) and has been impli-
cated in neuronal positioning and dendrite orientation (62). NCAM180 may interact 
directly with the NR2A subunit (96) to help mediate synaptic plasticity (31). Fur-
thermore, integrins mediate the developmental switch from NR2B-containing recep-
tors to NR2A-containing receptors at synapses (41) and potentiate NMDAR-
mediated currents by activating src tyrosine kinases (21, 190). 
4.2 Presynaptic NMDARs 
NMDARs are also found at the presynaptic terminal. The effect of presynaptic 
NMDARs on synaptic transmission varies among regions of the central nervous 
system. In some areas they negatively regulate neuronal excitability. They can inhibit 
glutamate release in spinal cord (11), enhance GABA release in cerebellum (71), or 
mediate LTD in the cerebellum (38), cortex (304), and retinotectal projections (188). 
However, in other brain regions they positively impact synaptic transmission. Acti-
vation of presynaptic NMDARs enhances glutamate release in hippocampal CA1 
pyramidal neurons during early postnatal development (203) and is involved in asso-
ciative LTP of the lateral amygdala (128). Interestingly, the function of presynaptic 
NMDARs in the entorhinal cortex decreases during development but can be elevated 
during epileptic states (375). Presynaptic NMDARs may preferentially contain 
NR2B (138, 375) or NR2D subunits (11, 203, 328) along with NR1 subunits with 
exon 5 inserts in the N-terminal domain (356)."

5 Extrasynaptic NMDARs 
5.1 Distribution 
NMDARs in extrasynaptic membrane locations, i.e., anywhere except within the 
synaptic junction, consist largely of NR1/NR2B and NR1/NR2D receptor complexes 
(30, 183, 333); in fact, NR1/NR2D may never enter the synapse (30). In much of the 
adult brain, typical mature synapses contain mainly NMDARs with NR2A, while 
NR2B-containing NMDARs are common in the extrasynaptic membrane (255, 333, 
336). One explanation for this pattern is that NR2B-containing NMDARs are re-
moved more readily from synapses than NR2A-containing NMDARs (176, 255, 
336); in contrast, NR2A-containing NMDARs form more stable associations with 
PSD-95 at synapses (12, 255, 336). Nevertheless, this separation of NR2A in syn-
apses and NR2B in the extrasynaptic membrane is not absolute, since some NR2B 
occurs in adult synapses ((257, 333); either as NR1/NR2B or NR1/NR2A/NR2B). 
Conversely, extrasynaptic NMDARs can contain NR2A (183, 281, 327). Unlike 
hippocampal neurons, cerebellar granule cells lose all of their NR2B, both synaptic 
and extrasynaptic, in later maturation and have both NR2A and NR2C in the adult 
(91, 281). 
5.2 Function 
The function of the predominant separation of NMDARs into synaptic NR2A-
containing and extrasynaptic NR2B-containing receptors in adults is not clear, but 
may relate to a separation of short distance (synaptic) and long distance (extrasynap-
tic) signals. Thus, a precise release of glutamate at the synapse could activate synap-
tic receptors, while extensive release of glutamate followed by spillover into the 
extrasynaptic spaces could be required to activate extrasynaptic receptors. In this 
way, extrasynaptic NMDARs could elicit plastic changes to compensate for synapse 
overactivity. NR2A has been reported to be associated mainly with LTP and NR2B 
mainly with LTD (193, 369) although several studies show that both NR2A and 
NR2B can induce LTP (20, 363). However, problems in specificity of the antagonist 
used in the former studies make their results for NR2A problematic (90, 233, 363). 
rundown (decline in peak current with repeated, sustained agonist application) than 
synaptic NMDARs, apparently for both NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDARs 
(183). Rundown may protect neurons from damage following hyperactivity leading 
to glutamate spillover. In addition, activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs generates 
inhibitory currents via BK-type calcium-activated potassium channels in rat olfactory 
bulb granule cells (134). Also, synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs can mediate 
opposite long-term changes in neuron gene expression, probably due to differences 
in their local, associated signaling complexes (reviewed by (214, 346, 388)). The 
signaling pathways of synaptic NMDARs selectively activate a regulatory cascade 
involving Ras, the kinase ERK, and CREB, while that of extrasynaptic NMDARs 
inactivate them. Thus, synaptic NMDARs promote CREB activation and induction 
Control of plasticity may depend more on location (synaptic versus extrasynaptic) 
rather than NR2 type. Thus, extrasynaptic NMDARs show a greater tendency for"

of BDNF gene expression, while extrasynaptic ones shut off CREB and inhibit 
BDNF gene expression (346). Activation of synaptic NMDARs may up-regulate pro-
survival genes and down-regulate pro-death genes, while activation of extrasynaptic 
NMDARs does the exact opposite (214, 388). Lastly, a more general function of 
extrasynaptic NMDARs is to form a mobile reserve pool of receptors for interchange 
with those in the synapse (338) (see below). 
5.3 Localization, Mobility, and Relation to Synaptic Receptors 
Relatively little is known about the arrangement and distribution of extrasynaptic 
NMDARs on the neuron cell membrane; in fact, relatively little is known about 
general protein distribution on the plasma membrane (163, 189). Some of the func-
tional studies noted above indicate the presence of some extrasynaptic NMDARs that 
may be stabilized in extrasynaptic domains, but other extrasynaptic NMDARs may 
be moving to sites of endocytosis or moving out of sites of exocytosis. In some 
cases, extrasynaptic NMDARs may associate with specialized non-synaptic junctions 
such as the cadherin-based attachment plaques of the cerebellar glomeruli. These 
contain abundant NMDARs and associated PSD-95, and thus glutamate spillover 
from adjacent synapses in the glomerulus may control the overall stability of the 
glomerulus (262). Other examples of specialized extrasynaptic locations of 
NMDARs are those on or near exocytic or endocytic zones or in the perisynaptic 
region directly surrounding the synapse. In addition, there are extrasynaptic 
NMDARs of presynaptic membranes. 
 
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis of NMDARs (and glutamate receptors in general) 
may be localized mainly to the extrasynaptic membrane on the side of a spine (24, 
258, 273). While this location is typical for endocytosis in mature synaptic spines, in 
immature synapses and early postnatal ages, the site of endocytosis often is located 
at the edge of the postsynaptic density (PSD) in the perisynaptic region (24, 258). 
Only a few examples of labeling for NMDARs in clathrin-coated pits have been 
found ((258) and Petralia et al., unpublished data). Also, RNAi knockdown of CPG2 
(candidate plasticity gene 2), which is localized specifically to the postsynaptic en-
docytotic zone of excitatory synapses, increases the number of postsynaptic clathrin-
coated vesicles, including some that contain NMDARs, and increases the number of 
surface NR1 and AMPAR GluR2 molecules (53). 
 
Targeting of the NMDARs to sites of endocytosis may be influenced by stabiliza-
tion of NMDARs on the surface, especially in extrasynaptic locations. GIPC is asso-
ciated with endocytosis and contains a PDZ domain that binds to the C-terminal 
ESDV domain of NR2B. Preliminary studies indicate that GIPC helps regulate the 
surface stabilization, endocytosis, and recycling of NMDARs, but the localization of 
extrasynaptic GIPC/NMDAR associations is not clear (379, 380). The adaptor 
PACSIN1/syndapin1 binds to the C-terminal of the NR3A, as well as to dynamin 
and the actin-organizing protein N-WASP, and mediates the selective endocytosis of 
NR3A-containing NMDARs during postnatal development. This mechanism is activ-
ity-dependent and may help regulate synaptic maturation (253). In this case, NR3A 
is localized largely in the outer zone of the synapse and in the adjacent perisynaptic"

area; it is suggested that PACSIN1 might facilitate movement of NR3A out of syn-
apses and into the endocytic zone on the side of the spine. 
 
It is not clear exactly where NMDARs and other glutamate receptors enter the 
plasma membrane via exocytosis (105, 152). Labeling for AMPARs is often seen in 
pit-like structures, without evident clathrin coats, on the sides of spines in adults 
(258, 259, 332). These structures probably correspond to the noncoated pits seen in 
structural studies in these locations (311) and could be exocytic sites or noncoated 
endocytic sites. Preliminary data indicate that the soluble NSF attachment protein 
receptor (SNARE), SNAP-23, is concentrated in this area, suggesting that these are 
sites of exocytosis or sites of lipid raft/caveoli, which might be involved in receptor 
regulation (64, 123, 141). In addition to these possible sites of exocytosis of AM-
PARs on the sides of spines (248), we also find immunogold-labeled vesicles and 
pits, labeled with either AMPARs or NMDARs, in the perisynaptic region and pos-
sibly within the PSD itself (102, 259, 260). Consistent with this, some studies have 
suggested that NMDARs could be incorporated more directly into synapses, pre-
sumably via actin/myosin-mediated transport (110), although it also has been re-
ported that newly-exocytosed NMDARs form extrasynaptic clusters first (276). 
 
In any case, wherever they reach the surface, NMDARs can be very mobile in the 
surface membrane, and thus may move readily to and from sites of function (334). In 
hippocampal neuron cultures, at least 65% of synaptic NMDARs are mobile and can 
be exchanged rapidly (334). Extrasynaptic NMDARs are not as mobile as extra-
synaptic AMPARs, while mobility for these two kinds of receptors is similar within 
the synapse (104, 338). Also, while changes in neuronal activity modify AMPAR 
mobility but not NMDAR mobility, activation of PKC modifies mobility for both 
(104, 338). These latter studies employed live surface labeling of native NMDARs 
on cultured hippocampal neurons using either single molecule-fluorescence micros-
copy tracking of receptors labeled with Cy3-coupled antibodies or single particle-
tracking of semiconductor quantum dot-coupled antibodies. Similar methods reveal 
that NR2A-containing NMDARs are less mobile than NR2B-containing NMDARs 
(105). In addition, overexpression of NR2A subunits reduces surface diffusion of 
NR2B-containing NMDARs, possibly due to formation of NR1/NR2A/NR2B trihet-
eromers that retain the stabilizing effect of NR2A. One caveat for these studies is 
that they are limited by the resolution of light microscopy; their definitions of synap-
tic versus extrasynaptic areas cannot be as accurate as those obtained with electron 
microscopy (EM). EM using markers such as DAB and immunogold may be useful 
for showing surface localization of glutamate receptors including AMPARs (258) 
and NMDARs (Petralia et al., unpublished data). Nevertheless, such EM studies may 
be affected by artifacts such as DAB “bleeding” and restrictions of movements of the 
relatively large gold particles, which may have difficulty entering into the synaptic 
cleft (for surface labeling protocols;(258) and Petralia et al., unpublished data); simi-
lar difficulties are indicated in the above light microscope studies comparing Cy3 
tracking versus the larger quantum dots."

6 NMDARs in Developing Neurons 
6.1 Subunit Changes During Development 
NMDARs are already present throughout the brain in embryos and include mainly 
 
As noted above, the major change in NMDAR subunits in development is the 
switch from primarily NR2B-containing receptors to those having mainly NR2A 
subunits. This switchover within synapses has been confirmed specifically with 
ultrastructural studies in the thalamus and cerebral cortex (84, 194) and hippocampus 
(257). The latter study examined postnatal development in the CA1 region of the 
hippocampus using EM immunogold analysis, and results correlate well with previ-
ous immunoblot analyses (287). Synaptic labeling for NR2B is highest at P2 and 
decreases gradually to approximately half that level by P35. In contrast, immunogold 
labeling for NR2A at synapses is present but very low at P2, and there is about 
twelve times as much present by P35; this is consistent with mRNA studies in the 
mouse, where the first distinct signal for NR2A is in the CA1 region of the hippo-
campus at P1, and this is followed by a substantial increase throughout the brain over 
the next 2 postnatal weeks (360). Interestingly, AMPARs are not common at these 
synapses at P2, and like NR2A, they increase during maturation (261). Such syn-
apses are probably “silent synapses” (133) because, in the absence of AMPARs, the 
NMDAR channels remain blocked by magnesium during neurotransmitter release; 
activation of these channels normally requires activation of AMPARs and the subse-
quent change in membrane potential necessary to release the magnesium block. 
Without AMPARs, activation of these early NMDAR-containing synapses might 
require initial activation of excitatory GABA receptors, which are prevalent in the 
early postnatal brain ((342); but see also (250)). Alternatively or in addition, activa-
tion of NR2B-containing NMDARs could be preceded by activation of NMDARs 
with low sensitivity to magnesium, including those with NR2C, NR2D, or NR3A 
(252) (see also Sections 4.2, 5, and 6.3). Several studies show that the switch from 
NR2B- to NR2A-containing NMDARs is linked to learning experiences (255), in-
cluding visual experience (271, 272) and rule learning in odor discrimination (270). 
NR1, NR2B, NR2D and NR3A (discussed below in relation to neuronal migration), 
and maintain this pattern in early postnatal development (see also Section 1). Over-
all, NR2B, NR2D and NR3A tend to decrease during later postnatal development 
and maturation; conversely, NMDARs that contain NR2A and/or NR2C tend to 
become more abundant in the maturing brain (50, 150, 173, 360, 365); relative levels 
of different NR1 splice variants also change with age (175). This has been studied 
best in the forebrain and cerebellum (see below), and exceptions occur in other areas. 
Thus, motoneurons of the hypoglossal, facial and trigeminal motor nuclei in the 
mouse express abundant mRNA for NR2A early in development (245). In the hypo-
glossal nucleus, NR2A mRNA is high at least by embryonic day 13 (E13) and peaks 
at P1-P7; the protein is evident at least by P1. It is likely that this early appearance of 
NR2A in these motoneurons reflects their function in the suckling reflex at birth. 
However, NR2A knockout mice manage to develop normally after birth, perhaps due 
to substitution of NR2B for NR2A in these circuits."

R.J. Wenthold et al. 
 
This change is also accompanied by an increase in PSD-95 (255, 287, 381) as dis-
cussed in other sections of this chapter. 
 
Another major switch in NR2 subunits of NMDARs occurs in cerebellar granule 
cells, where NR2C replaces NR2B. Once the granule cells complete migration and 
are innervated by the mossy fibers, they down-regulate NR2B and begin to express 
NR2C (246), developing in a caudal to rostral progression through the cerebellum 
(142); note also that NR2A is present during this period (91, 281). Expression of 
NR2C by granule cells is regulated by neuregulin secreted by mossy fiber terminals. 
Neuregulin can interact with ErbB2 and ErbB4 receptors on granule cells, inducing 
NR2C expression. In this case, expression of NR2C may involve MAGUKs that can 
form an indirect structural link between neuregulin and NMDARs (98, 111). 
6.2 Role in Synapse Formation 
NMDARs probably are not present in the earliest nascent excitatory synaptic con-
tacts, which likely are formed largely by various adhesion factors ((186, 257, 391); 
labeling for catenin shows a preference for the more immature-appearing synaptic 
contacts, while in comparison, labeling for NR2B, SAP102, and Homer 1b/c is more 
prevalent on the mature-appearing synapses, again suggesting a progression with 
adhesion proteins preceding entry of other proteins at early synaptic contacts (257). 
 
After the initial contact mediated by adhesion factors, presynaptic components 
can be delivered in packets, followed by delivery of postsynaptic MAGUKs and 
NMDARs (89, 186). This process is surprisingly rapid; a distinctive PSD containing 
multiple proteins linked directly or indirectly to NMDARs is formed in less than two 
hours (28, 89). Consistent with this, ultrastructural studies of the developing CA1 
region of the hippocampus at P2 reveal that many PSDs appear to be relatively ma-
ture and they label with immunogold for many of the proteins found in adult syn-
apses (257). Also, the spatial arrangements of these proteins resemble those found in 
the adult. Thus, at all ages studied (P2, P10 and adult), positions of gold labeling for 
PSD proteins reflect their molecular associations. For example, NMDARs at the 
postsynaptic membrane link to MAGUKs, which link to GKAP and subsequently to 
Shank and Homer; these latter two are positioned below the density where they can 
form further links to proteins in internal storage organelles and to other proteins in 
see also above in Section 4.1.5). One example is NCAM, which associates with both 
sides of nascent synaptic contacts and may play a major role in synaptogenesis and 
synapse maturation (266, 323). Other adhesion factors implicated in the earliest 
contacts are neuroligin, EphB receptors, and cadherins/catenins (discussed above in 
the Section 4.1.5). In the CA1 stratum radiatum of the hippocampus, immunogold 
the perisynaptic membrane surrounding the synapse.  
 
In these developing synapses of the hippocampus, while this basic chain of mole-
cules remains the same throughout postnatal development, the forms of the first  
three components, i.e., NMDARs, MAGUKs, and GKAP, change from types preva-
lent in early development to those more prevalent in the adult. Thus, as noted above: 
(1) the predominant NMDAR changes from NR2B- to mainly NR2A-containing, (2) 
the predominant MAGUK changes from SAP102 to mainly PSD-95, and also (3) the 
predominant GKAP changes from mainly a higher molecular weight form (130 kD)"

The final stage in the maturation of excitatory synapses, especially those on prin-
cipal output neurons, is the development of the postsynaptic spine. A number of 
proteins that bind to NMDARs or to NMDAR-associated proteins help regulate actin 
formation, which is a major component of spine formation. The NR2A-binding pro-
tein α1-chimerin contains a GTPase-activating (GAP) domain that can inhibit the 
Rho GTPase family member Rac1; Rac1 promotes actin polymerization, increases 
dendrite arbor complexity, and stimulates spine formation (344). EphB2 receptors 
6.3 Neuronal Migration and Neurite Outgrowth 
NMDARs are expressed on the surface of young neurons prior to synapse formation 
and can modulate neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth and differentiation. In 
mice, mRNAs for NR1 and NR2B are widespread throughout the brain (along with a 
more restricted distribution of NR2D) by E13 (360). Also, NR3A mRNA is present 
in the rat brain at least by E15 (50), and its earliest distribution is somewhat similar 
to that of NR2D in mice. In rats, functional NMDARs that respond to endogenous 
neurotransmitters appear on neurons of the cortical plate at least by E16 (within one 
day of the first appearance of this structure; (197)). Neuronal migration appears to 
to a more even mixture of two forms (130 and 95 kD) in the adult (257, 287, 345, 
381). Note, however, that in adults, NR2B and SAP102 are still fairly common at 
synapses in the hippocampus, but the overall pattern of NMDAR/MAGUK/GKAP 
has changed dramatically during maturation. The importance of these changes is 
reflected in studies of NR2A knockout mice (336). In visual neurons in these mice, 
PSD-95 may not form an effective scaffold for NR2B-containing NMDARs, since 
there is a selective loss of spontaneous NMDAR currents in these mice during devel-
opment. Again, normally there would be a general replacement of NR2B-containing 
NMDARs that are associated with SAP102, with NR2A-containing NMDARs 
that are associated with PSD-95. However, it is not clear how selective this 
NMDAR/MAGUK association may be; at least in adults, NR2A and NR2B appear to 
associate equally with SAP102, PSD-95 and PSD-93 (3). Another change during 
synapse maturation is the appearance of CaMKIIα, which is usually absent from 
early postnatal synapses (257); although other isoforms such as CaMKIIβ may be 
present early on. Switching from NR2B-containing NMDARs, which bind CaMKII 
with high affinity, to NR2A-containing NMDARs, which bind CaMKII with low 
affinity, results in a substantial reduction in LTP and may be associated with the 
reduced plasticity of glutamatergic synapses of the mature forebrain (13). 
can bind to NMDARs and play a role in Rac regulation and spine formation ((221, 
330, 331); see also Sections 4.1.4 and 4.1.5). SPAR is a Rap-specific GAP that binds 
to the GK domain of PSD-95 and regulates spine morphology, both via a direct in-
teraction with actin and perhaps also through Rap signaling (247). Finally, citron is a 
PSD-95-associated protein that may mediate forms of NMDAR-dependent synaptic 
plasticity in some specialized neurons; it is a target of Rho, which regulates organi-
zation of the actin skeleton (94, 389). In spite of these studies indicating that 
NMDARs play roles in spine formation, mice with CA1-targeted NR1-knockout 
(NR1 is lost gradually, mainly during late postnatal development) nevertheless can 
maintain spines and even may produce new spines in the adult after environmental 
enrichment (92, 275)."

involve glutamate and GABA receptors to varying degrees, depending on neuron 
type, region, and stage in development. In the mouse embryonic cortex, glutamate 
acts at NMDARs to stimulate neuronal migration (18). In the hippocampus, GABA 
and NMDA receptors modulate radial migration of pyramidal neurons, while, in 
contrast, tangential migration of interneurons involves AMPARs but not GABA or 
NMDARs (204, 205). In the mouse olfactory bulb, tangentially migrating neurons 
express GABA receptors first, then calcium-impermeable (presumably containing 
GluR2) AMPARs, and express NMDARs only after changing to radial migration 
(37). Similarly, migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons from their 
origin in the nose and then into the brain is enhanced by AMPAR (including all four 
AMPAR subunits) activation (303). Once in the brain, these neurons begin express-
ing NMDARs, which may slow migration. In the mouse cerebellum, the rate of 
granule cell migration is regulated by changes in calcium influx through N-type 
calcium channels and NMDARs; completion of migration involves the loss of these 
transient calcium elevations (155, 159). Note also that neuronal migration can in-
volve various locomotor mechanisms that differ in sensitivity to NMDAR and other 
receptor activation. Thus, in mouse cortical interneurons, nucleokinesis (movement 
of the nucleus through the neuron) involves a calcium elevation in the proximal 
region of the leading process, and this does not involve responses to agonists includ-
ing NMDA (227). Finally, overall neuroanatomy at birth in full NR1 knockout mice 
appears normal, suggesting that at least embryonic neuronal migration can proceed 
in the absence of functional NMDARs, presumably due to some compensatory 
mechanisms (88). 
 
Once a neuron migrates to its final destination, it undergoes substantial differen-
tiation involving neurite outgrowth, including both axon and dendrites, and dendrite 
arborization, involving formation of specific branching patterns. Early studies impli-
cated NMDARs in neurite outgrowth. In rat cerebellar granule cell cultures, NMDA 
application increases the rate of neurite outgrowth and the proportion of neuronal 
processes with growth cones, while the NMDAR antagonist APV causes a retraction 
of existing processes (251, 277). Similarly, in rat hippocampal dentate gyrus granule 
cell cultures, NMDA increases total neurite length and the number of branch points 
per neuron, although it does not affect the number of major neurite branches off of 
the soma (29). Interestingly, the effect of NMDARs is different for growing axons 
and dendrites. In developing neurons of Xenopus optic tectum, during early devel-
opment of the dendritic arbor, APV treatment decreases the number of branch exten-
sions and new branch additions (274). These effects are independent of the genera-
tion of sodium-dependent action potentials since they are not affected by TTX. Thus, 
they may involve NMDARs that are either extrasynaptic or are synaptic but activated 
by inputs that are below the threshold needed for firing action potentials. Later in 
development, when the dendritic arbor is more complex, AMPARs and NMDARs 
appear to work together to control the rate of branch length extension, and antago-
nists to both AMPARs and NMDARs decrease growth rates (274). However, an-
tagonists cannot alter rates of branch additions or retractions in these more mature 
arbors. Others have found evidence that NMDARs can suppress neurite sprouting 
and elongation in cultured Xenopus optic tectal neurons (191, 220). This is depend-
ent on calcium influx through NMDARs at the earliest neurite contacts between"

young neurons; these NMDARs show low magnesium sensitivity and their activation 
may be mediated by co-activation of type II metabotropic glutamate receptors. Es-
sentially, this mechanism allows the neurite to stop growing when it has found a 
suitable contact, and appears to apply at least to axonal neurites (effects on dendrites 
are less clear). These controls of axon growth in Xenopus optic tectal neurons were 
clarified by Ruthazer et al. (282) in which they show that NMDARs help mediate 
axon branch elimination from inappropriate locations and selective stabilization of 
branches to appropriate locations. Similarly, in rat hippocampal slice cultures, 
NMDARs can suppress axonal outgrowth (211). Also, Colonnese et al. (52) exam-
ined axon sprouting in the superficial visual layers of the superior colliculus of the 
rat and found that during early postnatal ages, activation of NMDARs seems to re-
duce early axon sprouting and synapse formation. In conclusion, it appears that 
NMDARs in immature neurons can stimulate the growth of the dendrite arbor and 
also regulate the stabilization of early axon-dendrite contacts, by modulating axonal 
growth and synapse formation. 
7 NMDA Receptor Trafficking and Disease 
Excessive calcium influx through the NMDAR may trigger excitotoxic cell death 
(55, 201). Interestingly, increased intracellular calcium resulting from other channel 
or receptor activities does not lead to excitotoxic cell death, implying that NMDAR-
mediated calcium influx mediates specific downstream signaling cascades that may 
ultimately lead to cell death (341). While excitotoxic cell death has been regarded to 
be the major mechanism by which NMDARs contribute to these disease states, 
mounting evidence suggests that disruptions in NMDAR trafficking and targeting 
may play a distinct role. Loss of synaptic function, involving disruptions in protein 
complexes and/or NMDAR dysfunction, may mediate a collapse of the synaptic 
functional unit in the absence of calcium-mediated cell death. Furthermore, while 
loss of synaptic function was believed to result from excitotoxic cell death, evidence 
suggests that these changes may actually occur before cell death and, in some dis-
eases, pre-symptomatically (85, 107, 296, 306). Thus, the complex nature of 
NMDAR function in disease states has expanded beyond the traditional view of 
excitotoxic cell death to include NMDAR deregulation. Extensive reviews have been 
published that thoroughly detail the role of NMDARs in multiple diseases; therefore, 
our goal is to review recent developments addressing NMDAR mistargeting in neu-
ropathological conditions (for a recent review, see (170)). 
7.1 NMDAR Subunit-Specific Determinants of Excitotoxic Cell Death 
Mechanisms of NMDAR deregulation may be common to various diseases. Firstly, 
NMDAR subunit composition is an important determinant in NMDAR-mediated 
excitotoxicity: cells transfected with NR1/NR2B or NR1/NR2A subunits are more 
susceptible to cell death than those transfected with NR1/NR2C or NR1/NR2D 
(201). These subunit-specific effects may be determined by higher calcium perme-
ability of NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B NMDARs. Furthermore, increases in toxicity"

R.J. Wenthold et al. 
 
occur with development as NR2B decreases and NR2A increases (46), consistent 
with subunit-specific vulnerability to excitotoxic cell death. 
 
Secondly, subcellular localization may determine subunit-specific effects. NR2A-
containing receptors are enriched at the synapse while NR2B-containing receptors 
are found extrasynaptically and are coupled to distinct downstream signaling cas-
cades (see Section 5). Extrasynaptic NMDARs are associated with the induction of 
cell death mechanisms, while synaptic receptors mediate induction of synaptic plas-
ticity mechanisms (116, 310). Thus, multiple factors such as subunit composition 
and localization are involved in determining whether NMDAR activation will lead to 
synaptic plasticity or to neurotoxicity (115). 
7.2 Huntington’s Disease 
Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that results in 
cognitive deficits, motor decline, and mood dysfunction (118). Cell death occurs 
most extensively in GABAergic projection medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) of 
the neostriatum and, to a lesser extent, in the cortex (349). Expansion of the polyglu-
tamine repeat in the gene encoding the protein huntingtin (htt) has been identified as 
the cause of the disease (168). 
 
Numerous lines of evidence implicate the NMDAR in HD neuropathology (for 
review, see (85)). A disproportionate loss of NMDAR binding sites occurs in the 
striatum of HD patients compared to GABAergic or cholinergic binding sites, sug-
gesting that NMDAR expression increases vulnerability of the neurons to cell death 
(382). Administration of NMDAR agonists such as quinolinic acid into the striatum 
in rodents and primates induces HD-like behavioral and neuropathological symptoms 
(114, 292). In addition, in cultured striatal neurons, NMDAR agonists induce neuro-
toxicity more effectively than agonists for other glutamate receptor subclasses (re-
viewed in (65)). In HD, cognitive deficits often precede motor symptoms (137, 177, 
249). Similarly, presymptomatic alterations in glutamatergic transmission occur in 
dissociated cortical neurons from a mouse model of HD (8), suggesting a role for the 
NMDARs in the disease independent of excitotoxicity. In a transgenic Huntington’s 
mouse model, NMDAR physiological properties were altered in a population of 
MSNs, exhibiting an increased response to glutamate and decreased sensitivity to 
magnesium (315). Mouse models of HD display behavioral and electrophysiological 
alterations in the absence of cell loss (181), suggesting that the observed neuropa-
thology is not merely the result of cell death. 
 
While numerous studies report inconsistent results regarding changes in NMDAR 
subunit expression (for review, see (85)), a specific role for NR2B has been identi-
fied (44). The striatum is enriched in NR2B (160, 169) with a significantly higher 
ratio of NR2B to NR2A than in cortex or hippocampus (185). Furthermore, the ma-
jority of NMDARs in MSNs are sensitive to the NR2B-specific antagonist ifen-
prodil, which is as effective at blocking NMDAR-mediated cell death as the 
NMDAR antagonist MK-801 (387), indicating a high population of NR2B-
containing receptors. The current model suggests that striatal neurons expressing 
NR2B are more susceptible to excitotoxic cell death (387) (see above in the Section 
7.1). Co-expression of NR2B with mutant htt in HEK293 cells leads to larger"
43,"===== Page 25 =====
Molecular Properties and Cell Biology of the NMDA Receptor

NMDAR currents than with wild-type htt, while no differences are seen when NR2A 
is co-expressed with mutant versus wild-type htt (44). Apoptotic cell death is also 
significantly greater in cells co-transfected with mutant htt and NR2B, but not NR2A 
(386). Furthermore, the NR2B subunit is enriched extrasynaptically, and a role for 
extrasynaptic NR2B-containing receptors in mediating cell death has been suggested 
(116, 310). 
 
NMDAR function may be affected by other factors, such as receptor trafficking. 
NR1 localization on the cell surface is increased in cultured MSNs from transgenic 
mice expressing htt with moderately expanded polyglutamine lengths, and NMDAR 
may be linked to htt by cytoskeletal proteins (85), supporting a trafficking compo-
nent. Additionally, the SH3 domain of PSD-95, which plays a role in NMDAR syn-
 
In addition to protein associations, NMDAR function may be altered in HD by 
changes in phosphorylation of the NMDAR and its downstream signaling partners. 
Mutant htt, but not wild-type htt, increases phosphorylated Src and targeting of acti-
vated phospho-Src and PSD-95 to membrane fractions (309). As mentioned above, 
Src regulates NMDAR channel activity. Additionally, changes in PKC and PKA 
phosphorylation may be affected by mutant htt (85). Studies on transgenic mouse 
models of HD report decrease of NR1 phosphorylation at Ser897 (136), which re-
sults in decreased dopamine D1-mediated CREB activation (70). Inhibition of CRE-
mediated gene transcription has been linked to HD (168), and decreased CREB ac-
tivity has been linked to increased NMDAR-mediated cell death (116). Further sup-
port for a role for NMDAR-mediated downstream signaling events in HD neuropa-
thology comes from a study reporting increased CRE-mediated transcription in 
transgenic mice over-expressing mutant htt compared with mice overexpressing 
wild-type htt (239). 
7.3 Alzheimer’s Disease 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized 
by impairments in memory and cognition, likely caused by the pathogenic accumula-
tion of a hydrophobic 42-amino-acid form of the β-amyloid peptide. While much of 
the earlier work focused on the role of the cholinergic system, mounting evidence 
suggests AD also exhibits a glutamatergic synaptic dysfunction in early disease 
stages (296, 306). Memantine, a non-competitive antagonist that more effectively  
 
aptic localization (see above in Section 4.1.4), binds htt in transfected HEK293 cells 
and in human cortical tissue (322). The PSD-95/htt association decreases in the pres-
ence of mutant htt, presumably increasing the availability of unbound PSD-95 to 
bind to NMDARs (322) and stabilize them on the cell surface (279). Thus, wild-type 
htt serves a neuroprotective role by blocking excessive NMDAR activity (178). 
Furthermore, PSD-95 links NMDARs to downstream signaling molecules, including 
neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) (48); in a transgenic model of HD, a decrease 
in membrane-associated nNOS was observed in addition to a decrease in PSD-95 
(136, 200). Therefore, the presence of mutant htt may disrupt NMDAR function not 
only by increasing calcium influx, but also by disrupting normal synaptic function."

blocks highly activated NMDARs, such as occurs in pathological conditions, but not 
during normal physiological activation (192), has been approved for treatment of AD 
(289). 
 
One early observation linking synaptic changes to AD is the reported loss of 
synaptic spines in biopsied and postmortem AD brains, accompanied by a decrease 
in the number of synapses per cortical neuron (60). These findings have since been 
confirmed (165, 301), and more recent studies report that loss of synapses occurs by 
an NMDAR-dependent mechanism (298). Furthermore, β-amyloid oligomers were 
found to interrupt synaptic plasticity in vivo and in slices (166) and to transiently 
impair learned behavior in rats (51, 335, 351). Interestingly, non-toxic amounts of 
secreted β-amyloid reduce synaptic plasticity and glutamatergic transmission (140), 
suggesting an effect on NMDAR transmission that is independent of cell death. 
 
Alterations of NMDAR subunit expression have been reported in analyses of 
postmortem AD brain. NR1 isoforms containing the N1 alternatively spliced cassette 
are decreased in AD affected patients in brain regions most susceptible to pathologi-
cal damage (129, 130). Furthermore, while levels of NR2C and NR2D mRNA are 
not altered, NR2A and NR2B mRNA and protein show a decrease in susceptible 
brain regions (131). In a study investigating subunit expression in hippocampal 
subregions, NR1 and NR2B mRNA and protein levels were reduced, while NR2A 
mRNA and protein levels were unchanged (219), suggesting an altered neuronal 
vulnerability. Additional studies investigating subunit expression have reported in-
consistent results, suggesting that additional mechanisms may be involved in the 
neuropathological changes (reviewed in (132)). 
 
Protein trafficking may also play a role in the neuropathology of AD. Interest-
ingly, β-amyloid decreases NMDAR localization at synaptic sites (308). Addition-
ally, the 42-amino-acid form of β-amyloid increases endocytosis of NMDAR in 
cultured cortical neurons and in transgenic mice expressing mutant amyloid precur-
sor protein (APP), with no affect on the GABAA β 2/3 subunit (308). Furthermore, 
an increase in the tyrosine phosphatase function of Striatal-Enriched Phosphatase 
(STEP) is responsible for the decrease in phosphorylation of NR2B at Tyr1472 
(308), which results in increased endocytosis of the receptor (279). One might specu-
late that prolonged depression of NMDAR-mediated transmission may initiate the 
pathological changes. Alternatively, a depression of NMDAR function may be neu-
roprotective based on the finding that preconditioning with β-amyloid reduces glu-
tamate-induced neurotoxicity by promoting endocytosis of NMDARs (103). 
7.4 Parkinson’s Disease 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive disorder characterized by degeneration of 
the dopaminergic neurons projecting from the substantia nigra to the striatum. Ani-
mal models of PD, including nigrostriatal denervation induced by 6-
hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injections, mimic this dopamine deficit (112) (for 
review, see (99, 113)). Treatment with L-DOPA (levodopa) alleviates the character-
istic symptoms of PD, which include resting tremors, rigidity, and other motor symp-
toms. However, chronic treatment results in dyskinesia, i.e., abnormal, involuntary 
spasmodic movements (113). NMDAR antagonists, including the NR2B antagonists"

ifenprodil and CP-101,606, are effective in reducing the neuropathology in experi-
mental models (195, 232) as well as in humans (343), suggesting a role for the glu-
tamatergic system in PD neuropathology. 
 
Alterations in the subcellular organization and function of NMDARs have been 
(112) (for review, see (99, 113)). In the unilateral 6-OHDA model of PD, alterations 
in synaptic function include reorganization of spines (34), decrease in synapse num-
ber (9), and reduction of LTP and LTD (32, 33). Also, changes in NMDAR binding 
has been reported in experimental models of PD and human postmortem PD brain 
(reviewed in (113)). In human postmortem brain of PD patients, NR1 expression is 
not altered (35, 217); however, in a nonhuman primate model of dyskinesia, NR2A 
is upregulated (112). 
 
Changes in subunit composition, subcellular localization, and phosphorylation 
states of NMDARs have been reported in 6-OHDA mouse models of PD (74, 216, 
265). Similarly, in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, NR2B redistributes from a synaptic 
to an extrasynaptic localization (99). While no changes were observed in total 
NMDAR subunit expression ((74, 216); but see (240)), the abundance of NR1 and 
NR2B in synaptosomal membrane fractions was found to decrease in the lesioned 
striatum relative to unlesioned striatum, with no change in NR2A (74), indicating 
decreased synaptic localization. Significantly, chronic L-DOPA treatment of 6-
OHDA-lesioned rats restores the abundance of NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits in 
homogenate and synaptosomal membrane fractions (74, 240). 
 
While the exact mechanisms by which NR2B-containing receptors redistribute 
following 6-OHDA lesions are not known, these may be affected by changes in 
phosphorylation. NR2A and NR2B subunits in the synaptosomal membrane, but not 
the light membrane of synaptic vesicle-enriched fractions, are tyrosine phosphory-
lated (73). While no changes were measured in the phosphorylation of NR2A or 
NR2B in total homogenates (74, 216), changes in NR2B tyrosine phosphorylation 
were reported in the PD 6-OHDA lesion model (216, 240). This decrease in NR2B 
phosphorylation is specific for the subpopulation of NMDARs in the membrane 
fraction (74), suggesting that changes in phosphorylation alter subcellular localiza-
tion in PD. In support of this model, the dopamine D1 agonist increases NR1, NR2A, 
and NR2B localization to the synaptosomal membrane fraction and tyrosine phos-
phorylation of the subunits located in that fraction (73). 
 
Furthermore, dopamine depletion decreases phosphorylation of NR1 at Ser890 
and Ser896 in a unilateral 6-OHDA rat model of PD (74). While Ser897 was not 
affected in this study, increased phosphorylation was reported in another study utiliz-
ing the 6-OHDA model, as well as in an MPTP primate model of PD (23). Phos-
phorylation of Ser890 results in the dispersion of surface NMDARs (329), and in-
creased phosphorylation at Ser897 results in increased dopamine D1-mediated 
CREB activation (see Section 7.2 above) (70). Also, an increase in serine phosphory-
lation of NR2A, but not NR2B, was reported (241). Interestingly, chronic L-DOPA 
treatment enhances serine phosphorylation of NR1 at Ser890, Ser896, and Ser897 
and of NR2A, as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of both NR2A and NR2B (74, 
240, 241). These results indicate that surface delivery and/or stabilization can be 
regulated by dopamine via alterations in NMDAR subunit phosphorylation.

7.5 Schizophrenia and Mood Disorders 
Investigations into therapies for schizophrenia and mood disorders have more re-
cently focused on the glutamate dysfunction hypothesis (313). In the case of schizo-
phrenia, reduction of NMDAR function by non-competitive antagonists such as 
ketamine or phencyclidine result in dopaminergic hyperactivity and behavioral 
changes characteristic of schizophrenia (199). Altered NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and, 
interestingly, NR3A expression has been reported in postmortem tissue of schizo-
phrenic patients (68, 97, 212, 229). Additionally, mice expressing only 5% of normal 
levels of NR1 display behavioral abnormalities that correlate with schizophrenia, 
which can be reversed by treatment with the antipsychotics haloperidol or clozapine 
(223). Decreased striatal expression of SAP102 was reported (158), suggesting pos-
sible changes in trafficking or localization of NMDARs. Interestingly, schizophrenia 
is associated with hypofunction of the glutamatergic system (313); notably, this is 
strong evidence that NMDARs play a role in neuropathologies such as schizophrenia 
by mechanisms other than excitotoxic cell death. 
 
Neuregulins, which are widely expressed growth and differentiation factors, have 
been genetically linked to schizophrenia (316). Neuregulin function has been associ-
ated with changes in glutamatergic synapse function (109, 111), perhaps providing a 
link between neuregulins, glutamatergic hypofunction, and schizophrenia. The 
neuregulin-β isoform has been shown to induce NR2C mRNA expression in cultured 
cerebellar granule cells in an NMDAR activity-dependent manner (246). Further-
more, in the prefrontal cortex, neuregulin 1 promotes actin-dependent NMDAR 
internalization and decreases NMDAR-mediated EPSCs (109). While similar studies 
in hippocampal neurons report neuregulin-1-mediated decreases in AMPAR-
mediated EPSCs, not NMDAR EPSCs, and a corresponding increase in AMPAR 
endocytosis (164), these data support a role for glutamatergic regulation by 
neuregulins. Furthermore, analysis in postmortem brain tissue of schizophrenic pa-
tients identified a more tightly coupled complex of the neuregulin receptor ErbB4, 
PSD-95, and NMDARs than in normal controls (111). Neuregulin 1 activity sup-
presses NMDAR activation, an effect that is more pronounced in schizophrenic 
subjects than in normal controls (111). These data, therefore, suggest that the effects 
of neuregulins on NMDAR function may be related to the glutamatergic hypofunc-
tion model. 
 
Major depression and bipolar disorder have been linked to the glutamatergic 
system, largely as a result of effective treatment of these diseases with antagonists of 
NMDARs (384). Notably, subjects with major depressive disorder exhibited signifi-
cant improvements following a single dose of the NMDAR-specific antagonist 
ketamine (385). Furthermore, mice lacking the NR2A subunit exhibit anxiolytic and 
antidepressant-like effects (27). Exercise in NR2A knockout mice does not enhance 
neurogenesis as in wild-type mice (151), in agreement with the model that depres-
sion may result from impaired neurogenesis (17). Treatment of rats with lithium, an 
effective treatment for bipolar disorder, results in block of NMDAR-mediated signal-
ing via phopholipase A2 activation and arachadonic acid release (15). As in schizo-
phrenia, alterations in NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and, interestingly, NR3A subunit expres-
sion have been reported for bipolar disorder and depression (158, 207, 229, 370)."

Decreased striatal expression of PSD-95 and SAP102, or SAP102 only, has been 
reported in postmortem tissue of patients with bipolar disorder or depression, respec-
tively (158). 
7.6 Other Disorders 
NMDARs have also been implicated in other neuropathological conditions, includ-
ing lupus (61, 157), neuropathic pain (25), ischemia (354), epilepsy (99), ALS (80), 
and HIV dimentia (144).

1 Introduction 
Until recently, synapse organization was seen as rather stable, being modified only 
during plastic processes over time courses ranging from minutes to hours. Bulk ap-
proaches, i.e. probing large numbers (fifty to few hundreds) of molecules simultane-
ously has permitted the observation of dynamic reorganization of synaptic compo-
nents, and this has challenged the notion that synapses are stable entities. However, 
these approaches did not allow the behavior of individual molecules to be followed. 
The first single molecule technique to be used in synaptic biology was patch-clamp 
recordings measuring the electrophysiological properties of individual ion channels. 
This approach, though powerful, does not allow for a determination of the spatial 
distribution of a given molecule over time. As trafficking of molecular components 
has emerged as a major pathway in the regulation of synapse function, the field was 
searching for means to investigate the microscopic behavior of molecules with high 
spatio-temporal resolution. Once the concept was established that synaptic molecules 
are in movement, it was implicit that they are in reversible interactions in a short 
time scale (i.e. receptor scaffold interactions). 
 
The recent developments in single molecule imaging technologies are now lead-
ing to wide applications in cellular biology allowing for the unraveling of new 
mechanisms related to molecular movements. These advances were made possible 
by a combination of improvements in optical detectors combined with new molecu-
lar tagging strategies and the advent of biocompatible nanotechnological tools. 
 
Single molecule imaging has been critical for synaptic biology since molecules 
traffic between microdomains with specific molecular composition. In recent years, 
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP, e.g. (3, 143)) and single particle 
tracking (SPT, see (142)) have revealed that synaptic molecules move and change 
diffusive behavior over short time scales. A major advantage of tracking a single 
molecule over time is that it allows a direct access to the characteristic times of its

Fig. 1. Receptor trafficking from synthesis to insertion in the synapse. Receptors are synthe-
sized mainly in the cell body but possibly also in dendrites (67) and then trafficked intracellu-
larly along dendrites by microtubule based vesicular transport. There is debate (1, 100–102) 
on the site of insertion of receptors that could occur at the cell body (1), along dendrites (102), 
within the spine (100, 101), or even directly at the PSD (52). Receptor endocytosis occurs 
peri-synaptically. On the other hand, most receptors constantly move in and out synapses by 
lateral diffusion within the plane of the membrane. Receptors trafficking into and out of syn-
apses thus rely on sequential and complementary routes involving diffusion, endo- and exocy-
tosis. 
 
Multiple studies have shown that AMPAR localization is a very dynamic process, 
with AMPARs cycling in and out of synapses under a variety of situations related to 
synaptic plasticity and development (e.g. (12, 46, 78, 84, 86, 129, 145)). Similarly, 
NMDARs also cycle in and out synapses, albeit at slower rates (reviewed in (74)). 
3.1 Exocytosis 
One of the last steps in the long journey of receptors to the synapse is their delivery 
into the specialized dendritic membrane that constitutes the postsynaptic terminal. 
Exocytosis of receptors is not only required for insertion of new receptors in basal 
conditions but appears to be also required for LTP (81, 100). Dendritic recycling 
exocytosis, see Chapter by Lorena Arancibia-Carcamo et al., this volume. The wealth 
of data on metabotropic receptor endocytosis is not reviewed here as beyond the 
scope of this chapter.

endosomes contain the reserve pool of AMPARs mobilized during LTP and avail-
able for modifying synaptic strength (100, 101). As previously described, subunit-
specific functions govern the synaptic delivery of AMPARs in hippocampal slice 
cultures (61, 124, 148) and in dissociated cultures (102). The sites of receptor exocy-
tosis, either coming from a pool of newly synthesized receptors (67) or from a pool 
of recycling receptors, still remains elusive. Excitatory or inhibitory receptors could 
be either directly exocytozed at the synapse, as suggested by recent work (52), or 
first exocytosed in the extrasynaptic membrane and followed by their lateral diffu-
sion at the neuronal surface and trapping at synaptic sites. This was shown initially 
by using cleavable extracellular epitope tags on transfected receptors. These studies 
(102, 113) have suggested that glycine receptor and AMPARs can be inserted at the 
soma or along dendrites followed by their lateral translocation to synaptic sites. This 
approach indicated that receptors diffuse along dendrites with a linear speed of about 
1 µm/min (113). For AMPA receptors, it was established that the surface insertion of 
AMPARs occurs along dendrites in a subunit-dependent manner (102). Surface in-
sertion of the GluR1 subunit occurs slowly in basal conditions and is stimulated by 
NMDAR activation (see also (105)) and insulin, whereas GluR2 exocytosis is consti-
tutively rapid. Although both subunits ultimately concentrate in synapses, GluR2 
accumulation at synapses is faster than that of GluR1 suggesting that either GluR1 is 
inserted initially at extrasynaptic sites while GluR2 is inserted more directly at syn-
apses or that both receptors are inserted at extrasynaptic sites but that GluR2 diffuses 
faster in the membrane and can thus accumulate faster in synapses. The rapid accu-
mulation of newly exocytosed GluR2 subunits at synaptic sites was found to depend 
on the NSF binding sites in the C terminus of GluR2 (14). Similar dendritic insertion 
of AMPAR subunits was found in other studies using different types of epitope tags 
(bungarotoxin binding site or bi-arsenical dyes) (67, 120). 
 
Studies on native AMPARs found that LTP was accompanied by a rapid insertion 
of native AMPARs and by increased clustering of AMPARs at the surface of den-
dritic membranes. AMPAR insertion was blocked by intracellular tetanus toxin, 
providing evidence that AMPARs are inserted into excitatory synapses via a 
SNARE-dependent exocytosis during LTP (82). Real-time measurements of receptor 
exocytosis onto the surface of neurons have recently been made possible through the 
use of green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants that display strong pH-dependent 
fluorescence (ecliptic pHluorins) (91). Using this assay, it has been shown that 
chemically induced LTP rapidly enhances spine size with subsequent surface incor-
poration of GluR1 AMPARs by exocytosis from intracellular sites. GluR1 receptors 
increase on spine surfaces with no significant net change on the nearby dendrite. 
GluR2 receptors increase moderately and transiently on the spine surface (69). Al-
though the exact site of exocytosis could not be determined, the absence of change in 
net dendritic signal may suggest that there is no significant net shift of receptors 
from dendritic surface to spine surface. However, a small amount of lateral move-
ment from dendrite to spines could have been missed due to the large amount of 
dendritic surface receptors. A recent study on the role of components of the exocyst 
complex in AMPAR delivery have suggested that Exo70 mediates AMPAR insertion 
directly within the postsynaptic density, rather than at extrasynaptic membranes (52). 
Most interestingly, recent results indicate that LTP-inducing stimuli promote the"

mobilization of recycling endosomes and vesicles into spines, thus suggesting that 
AMPARs therein contained could be secondarily exocytosed in spines (101). 
 
However such model has been recently challenged. Adesnik et al. used a photo-
reactive AMPAR antagonist (6-azido-7-nitro-1,4-dihydroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, 
ANQX) (1, 29). Its global or focal photoactivation (by UV light) allows for meas-
urement of the recovery of currents after specific inactivation of all or a sub-
population of surface AMPARs. The turn-over rate of synaptic receptors with intra-
cellular pools was found to be surprisingly slow, in the time scale of several hours, 
differing from previous results. In contrast, AMPARs were shown to be rapidly 
exocytosed to the plasma membrane in the somatic compartment. Importantly it was 
also found that somatic surface AMPARs diffuse laterally at high rate. Thus, it is 
possible that new functional AMPARs in the dendrites come from receptors exocyto-
sed at the soma and traveling down dendrites by lateral diffusion. This model is 
however hard to reconcile with the wealth of data that has shown AMPARs recycling 
in dendrites and it is improbable that receptors are delivered to distal dendrites purely 
by diffusion at the neuronal surface as this would take extended periods of time (a 
few to several hours per 100 µm is an optimistic estimate). Moreover, it is not clear 
how this model fits with electrophysiological measurements indicating an increasing 
gradient of AMPA receptors as one moves proximally to distally in CA1 pyramidal 
neurons. 
 
In contrast to the flurry of information on AMPARs, much less is known regard-
ing the exocytosis of NMDARs. Interactions between SAP102 and Sec8 are involved 
in the delivery of NMDARs to the cell surface in heterologous cells and neurons 
(115). 
3.2 Endocytosis 
AMPARs undergo rapid constitutive internalization that is regulated by synaptic 
activity (46, 78). For NMDARs, constitutive internalization in mature neurons is 
slow relative to AMPARs and not regulated by activity but is rapid in immature 
neurons (46, 78, 112). Although NMDA receptors are thought to be relatively stable 
during synaptic plasticity, certain stimuli can induce their acute internalization (96, 
129). Mounting evidence suggests that the internalization of glutamate receptors is a 
primary mechanism of long-term depression (LTD) (12, 78, 86, 129, 145), wherein a 
specific stimulus causes a decrease in synaptic strength (11). Upon internalization, 
AMPARs are sorted in early endosomes either to a specialized recycling endosome 
compartment for reinsertion to the plasma membrane or to late endosomes and ly-
sosomes for degradation (46, 75). 
 
Where are the endocytosis sites? Glutamate receptor internalization is thought to 
occur through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (12, 28, 46, 78, 86, 145). An endocytic 
zone at the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses, segregated from the postsynap-
tic density (PSD), is thought to be the site of internalization for synaptic proteins, 
including glutamate receptors (17). Electron microscopy has shown the presence of 
clathrin-coated pits and vesicles in dendritic spines (36, 104, 131, 139). In young 
neurons, clathrin assembly and disassembly occur rapidly, locally, and repeatedly at 
“hot spots” throughout dendrites and at the tips of dendritic filopodia (17). In"

contrast, clathrin coats in mature dendrites reside in stable, long-lasting zones at sites 
of endocytosis, where clathrin undergoes continuous exchange with local cytosolic 
develop and persist independently of synaptic activity, akin to the PSD itself (17). 
 
Proteins mediating endocytosis are systematically arrayed within dendritic 
spines, tangential to the synapse (108). While the disruption of components of the 
general endocytic machinery has been shown to disrupt glutamate receptor internali-
zation (27, 83, 89, 147), CPG2 is a protein that was recently shown to be specifically 
involved in the internalization of postsynaptic proteins. CPG2 is a component of the 
postsynaptic endocytic pathway that mediates both constitutive and activity-
regulated glutamate receptor internalization (37). CPG2 localizes to an endocytic 
zone of excitatory synapses. CPG2 knockdown disrupts constitutive AMPAR and 
NMDAR internalization and activity-induced AMPAR internalization. Since CPG2 
is primarily localized to the postsynaptic endocytic zone of excitatory synapses, it is 
not a constitutive part of the ubiquitous endocytic machinery. In CPG2 knockdown 
neurons, there is an increase in synaptic glutamate receptors, which is likely due to 
the disruption of glutamate receptor endocytosis. Although some reports have indi-
cated that endocytosis inhibition does not affect the number of surface AMPARs (81, 
86), this data is consistent with results showing that acute blockade of endocytosis 
causes an increase in synaptic transmission (83). These ultrastructural data are cor-
roborated by direct imaging of removal of AMPARs from synapses showing that it is 
preceded by transient endocytosis of extrasynaptic AMPARs. Ecliptic pHluorin-
tagged GluR2 has been used to visualize changes in AMPAR surface expression in 
real time. Synaptic and extrasynaptic AMPARs respond very differently to NMDAR 
activation; there is a rapid internalization of extrasynaptic AMPARs that precedes 
the delayed removal of synaptic AMPARs (2). 
4 Approaches to Track Receptor Mobility 
Experimental studies of diffusion of particles have originally been carried out by 
using methods that measure the average behaviour of an entire population, such as 
dynamic light scattering (15) or neutron scattering (62) in physics, or FRAP (110) or 
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (6) commonly used in biology. Bulk 
measurements using FRAP demonstrated long ago that biological membranes are 
fluid mosaics (5). Early on, this was recognized to be also true for neuronal mem-
branes (e.g. (68)). However, single molecule techniques have only recently been 
applied in neuroscience (39, 133). 
 
For twenty years, optical methods have been developed for observing the motion 
of molecules through the use of single particle imaging (51, 117). These methods, 
referred to as SPT methods, rely on following the trajectory of a marker attached to 
the diffusing molecule. Transport properties of the particle are then derived through a 
statistical analysis of the trajectory, which includes measurement of the mean square 
displacement. 
 
Visualisation of the diffusive behaviour of single membrane proteins in living 
cells has revealed that these molecules undergo a variety of motions, such as 
Brownian, confined, or directed (70, 117). In this context, SPT is a powerful tool for 
pools (17). In dendritic spines, endocytic zones lie laterally to the PSD where they"

investigating the membrane structure and the mechanisms responsible for these mo-
tions, which ultimately influence reactions and interactions between biomolecules. 
Current analyses of trajectories allow the determination of the translational diffusion 
coefficient of a symmetric molecule which undergoes isotropic diffusion. 
4.1 Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching 
The first experimental approach used to measure surface protein trafficking was the 
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique (110). In this approach, mole-
cules of interest are tagged with a fluorophore (e.g. fluorescent irreversible antago-
nist or antibody). A small area of the cell is quickly photobleached using an intense 
excitation light and the rate of fluorescence recovery in the excited spot is monitored 
over time. The fluorescence recovery depends on protein mobility from the area 
surrounding the bleached spot. This technique only gives averaged estimates of pro-
tein mobility, as the movements of many molecules are measured simultaneously 
and derivation of diffusion coefficients are based on assumption on bleaching beam 
profile and membrane isotropy. Further, it has limited spatial resolution (~250 nm). 
The relationship between FRAP and single molecule tracking is discussed below. 
4.2 Single Particle and Molecule Tracking 
The emergence of single particle tracking experiments allowed real-time monitoring 
of the movement of individual or small groups of proteins (Fig. 2). In SPT ap-
proaches, submicrometer-sized particles are bound to the protein of interest, such as 
neurotransmitter receptors, through ligands that recognize the extracellular domain 
(7, 21, 33, 70, 117). Particles vary in composition, size and in the optical method 
used for their detection. 
 
The advent of fluorescence imaging in the 1990s together with the improvement 
of charge-coupled device (CCD) camera sensitivity allowed the detection of single 
fluorophores in living cells. Organic dyes were the first fluorescent probes to be used 
and present the advantages of being small (<1 nm), easily coupled to ligands by 
simple chemistry and amenable to multicolor detection. However their use is limited 
by their rapid (few seconds) photobleaching. 
 
To gather sufficient photons to image one dye molecule, the preparation must be 
excited at saturation through a defocused laser. However, this substantially acceler-
ates the photobleaching, and thus single dye molecules can usually be imaged for 
only few seconds (at 30 Hz rate acquisition). Thus, the single molecule detection 
approach provides the advantage of small probe size that enters confined spaces but 
has the disadvantage of a limited tracking time. An alternative approach, FCS, has 
been developed. Using FCS, the mobility of individual fluorescent molecules is 
measured as their residence time in a small illumination volume. The faster mole-
cules diffuse, the shorter their residence time is in the excitation volume. As with 
FRAP, this approach gives measurements of the population mobility. Furthermore, it 
is limited to the measurement of rapidly moving molecules, as the fluorophore must 
remain active during the whole period of residence in the measurement volume and 
not photobleach."

D. Choquet and A. Triller Fig. 2. Labeling methods for tracking single receptors. Labeling receptors relies on attaching a 
probe specifically to its extracellular domain. For probes, single molecule studies rely largely 
on fluorescent probes such as single organic dyes (top left) that photobleach rapidly (bottom 
left), or quantum dot nanocrystals (7) that are bulkier (top middle) but extremely photoresistant 
(top bottom). The new photothermal imaging approach (72) can image and track nano-gold 
particles as small as 1.4 nm and may provide an alternative nano-probe allowing tracking in 
very confined environments such as a living brain. 
 
New developments may reboost the use of organic fluorescent dyes by improving 
the time during which they can be imaged. Either by using antibleach reagents, by 
the development of new photoresistant dyes (45), or by increasing fluorescence sig-
nals through relaxation of transient molecular dark states, such as the triplet states, 
between two molecular absorption events (44). 
 
Small (nanometer range) non-organic fluorescent probes with virtually no photo-
bleaching, have been developed to circumvent the limitation of organic dyes. Quan-
tum dots (QD) which are nanometer-sized semiconductor fluorescent particles pro-
vide long-lasting fluorescence emission (10, 24, 90). The core fluorescent moiety of 
QD is a small CdSe crystal surrounded by a ZnS shell. It is hydrophobic and has to 
be encapsulated to ensure its biocompatibility, it then reaches a hydrodynamic size of 
15–25 nm. Their fluorescent properties include: (i) a high absorption cross section 
that allows the use of standard illumination sources and high signal to noise ratio 
allowing recordings at high rates (up to the kHz); (ii) a narrow emission wave length 
depending on the QD size; (iii) high photoresistance; (iv) non-ergodic blinking be-"

tween active and dark states that allows easy identification of individual QDs in 
temporal image series. 
 
However, despite these attempts to minimize the particle size, even the smallest 
ones (e.g. QDs) used to track receptors within confined spaces have shown limita-
tions, likely because of the complex size. Actual improvements in the QD structure, 
such as reduction of the core (few nanometers) or the organic shell sizes, will likely 
overcome this issue (106). 
 
An alternative imaging method has been developed that allows detection of 
nanometer sized metallic particles (Fig. 2). It relies on the use of a photothermal 
detection method (13, 23, 34, 72). Its main advantages over QDs are the absence of 
photobleaching or blinking. Gold nanoparticles are heat modulated at high frequency 
(MHz) at the plasmon resonance (530 nm) and the resulting change in the diffraction 
index is detected using a probe laser beam and a lock in amplifier. This allows detec-
proach has been used to track the movement of AMPARs in living neurons for over 
20 min (72). 
4.3 Surface Versus Intracellular Tracking 
4.4 Ligands 
Organic or inorganic probes, dyes or particles, have to be bound to the protein to be 
tracked through a specific linker ligand. Specificity can be achieved using natural 
ligands, peptides, chemical linkage, biotin, or antibodies. These links can be used to 
recognize endogenous unmodified receptors, or receptor subunits modified geneti-
cally or chemically to add a target tag. 
 
Adequate linkers between the probes and the studied molecules must fulfill some 
prerequisites: linkers have to bind extracellular domains of receptors in living cells 
without modifying their function; linker affinity has to be in the nanomolar range to 
ensure stability of the receptor-linker-probe complex. One of the most difficult re-
quirements is control over the stoichiometry of the receptor-to-probe interaction. 
This usually requires controlling not only the number of linkers on the probe, but 
also the number of acceptor sites on the studied molecule. 
tion of particles down to 5 nm at 100 Hz with heating of less than 1°C. This ap-
Up to now, the vast majority of single nano-object tracking studies have targeted the 
movement of cell surface molecules. A few exceptions lie in studies that have inves-
tigated the intracellular trafficking of viruses (119), molecular motors (25), endocy-
tosed receptors (26, 77) or whole single vesicles (38, 76). The absence of studies on 
the tracking of intracellular cytosolic proteins at the single molecule level mostly 
arises from the intrinsic difficulty in exogenously labelling them. On the one hand, 
most exogenous labels such as QDots are not membrane permeable (see (41)), and 
on the other hand intracellularly injected probes cannot be easily washed out. Ex-
panding the range of application of single particle/molecule studies to intracellular 
molecules will require the design of very high affinity (subnanomolar) cell perme-
able probes."

These requisites are met differently for the various ligands. In the central nervous 
system, there are only few natural ligands which can be used, mainly because their 
affinities are too low or because chemical modifications needed for their coupling to 
the probes destroys their binding properties. In most cases only antibodies are avail-
able for recognition. Specific tagging of receptors is best achieved using artificial 
tags added chemically or genetically allowing the use of excellent ligands. Various 
strategies have been used with success: epitope tags (88, 121), biotin tags (64), toxin 
binding sites (120), polyhistidine-NTA (73), cysteine modification (130). The link-
ing to the probe (a dye or a nano particle) is performed either by passive adsorption 
or by covalent linkage. For single molecule tracking it is usually straightforward to 
chemically link an organic fluophore. Fluorescent proteins (XFPs) represent a spe-
cific case in which the fluorophores are directly genetically encoded with the studied 
protein. However, the poor signal to noise ratio yielded by these natural fluorophores 
make them of difficult use for SMT (32). The recent progress in fluorescence excita-
tion procedures (44) may open the track to a new era for SMT of XFPs. 
 
In the case of particles, the situation is more complex as complexation of the 
ligand to the probe can alter the physical properties of one or the other. Interesting 
new directions lie is the direct binding of peptides to gold or QD nanoparticles, al-
lowing for marked decrease in the hydrodynamic radii of the probe-linker complex. 
In any case, the main hurdles appear to be the nonspecific binding of the probe to 
biological sample and the control of the stoichiometry of the probe-linker-target 
complex. Indeed, while it is relatively easy to ascertain a one-to-one labelling ratio of 
receptor to organic dyes, it is much more difficult to do it with functionalized parti-
cles. 
4.5 Effect of Label Size on Diffusion and Trafficking of Surface 
Receptors 
Particle or molecule movement, and therefore diffusion of the underlying receptors, 
is imaged by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy or fluo-
rescence imaging. The relative position of the particle is then measured with good 
accuracy (in the 10 nm range). In open spaces, the size of the tag only marginally 
influences the membrane protein movements, which are dominated by Brownian and 
viscous forces, because membrane viscosity is approximately 500-fold greater than 
that of extracellular fluids. The membrane-anchored receptors thus slow down the 
particles and not the opposite. This is of course only true when the probe diffusion is 
not hindered by extracellular molecular obstacles or narrow spaces between cells. 
Another issue lies in the difficulty to determine whether a given tracked particle 
remains at the cell surface and/or interferes with the endocytosis of the bound recep-
tor. On the one hand, the available particles do not report a surface versus intracellu-
lar localization and the optical resolution does not permit an unambiguous determi-
nation of this localization. Incorporation of pH sensitive dyes in particles may allow 
detecting internalization events through the normal acidification of the luminal do-
main within the endocytotic vesicles (128). On the other hand, there are few pub-
lished data that have studied the impact of particles on the endocytic process (26)."

4.6 Labelling of Surface Receptors 
Tracking individual receptors in primary neuronal cultures and other cultured cell 
types has now been achieved in many laboratories, and all the studies have con-
firmed the dynamic nature of membrane protein organization. However access to 
more intact systems (tissue slices and in vivo) has still resisted investigations at the 
single molecule level. A few recent reports have analyzed the dynamics of synaptic 
molecules in slices or in vivo using the FRAP approach (53). Interestingly, the dy-
namics which have been measured are only mildly quantitatively different from 
those found in neuronal culture. Two elements are detrimental to measurements of 
single molecules in tissue: the size of the probe, and light diffraction which imposes 
the need for a large number of photons. Measurement of diffusion volumes in brain 
slices indicate that probes with hydrodynamic diameters of 5–10 nm may be used to 
track receptors (136). The need for a high photon yield being already satisfied by 
QDs or metallic nanoparticles, development for small functionalizing linkers remain 
the main obstacle. In addition, rapid 3-D tracking is still to be developed. Altogether, 
tracking individual receptors in tissue slices is the next challenge that now seems to 
be within reach. 
4.7 Pointing Accuracy 
An important advantage of SPT and SMT approaches lies in their high pointing 
accuracy that allows localisation of the tracked object below the optical diffraction 
limits reaching in the best case few nanometers. This property results from the fact 
that pixel sizes are images of areas smaller than the point spread function of the 
optical pathway (PSF) and are intensity coded. The center of gravity of the image of 
the PSF on the CCD is a good approximation of the localization of the source and 
can be computed with a precision where signal variance is dominated by photon 
noise and varies according to the inverse square root of photon numbers. This im-
plies that the more photon is gathered the better is the pointing accuracy. The latter 
being given by: 
 
where λem, na, γ, A, and t denote the emission wavelength of the single molecule, the 
numerical aperture of the objective, the efficiency of the optical system, the emission 
rate of the single molecule and the acquisition time, respectively (98) 
 
Trajectories are reconstructed from sequences of images of single particles or 
molecules. First, single objects must be detected in the images. That a single object is 
detected is ascertained according to the adequate characteristics of each probe. In the 
case of micron-sized latex beads, the center of gravity of the image is used to posi-
tion the object. In the case of single fluorophores such as organic dyes or QDs, the 
object is smaller than the diffraction limit and thus its image corresponds to the point 
spread function of the optical system. Single organic dyes are recognized by one step 
photo-bleaching while single QD are identified by their fluorescence intermittency. 
Fluorescent spots are detected by cross-correlating the image with a Gaussian model"

of the point spread function. A least-squares Gaussian fit is applied (around the local 
maximum above a threshold) to determine the center of each spot with a spatial 
accuracy of 5–10 nm (depending on the signal-to-noise ratio). This is applied succes-
sively to each frame of the sequence. 
 
The pointing accuracy is different from the resolution, which is the ability to 
separate two objects. Single nano object imaging display the standard optical resolu-
tion given by half the light wavelength. Other techniques (see below) aim at breaking 
this diffraction limit. This is at the origin of the difficulty to assert colocalization of a 
single molecule with a bulk labelling (e.g. a synaptic stain) because strictly speaking 
the resolution is not improved. In case of multiple single nano-object markers, the 
use of pointing accuracy allows for the indirect improvement in resolution, breaking 
the diffraction limit, as recently applied in the PALM technique (16). 
4.8 Trajectory Reconstruction and Analysis 
After nano-object detection, trajectories are assembled automatically by linking, 
from frame to frame, the centers of fluorescent spots likely arising from the same 
probe (7, 21, 32). The association criterion is based on the assumption of free 
Brownian diffusion, and takes into account short blinking events in the case of QDs. 
For analysis, the following parameters can be calculated from the reconstructed 
trajectories: (1) The mean square displacement (117), which allows one to character-
ize the movement (directed, free Brownian or confined), (2) the diffusion coefficient 
(71) which characterizes the speed of molecular displacement; (3) the confinement 
area (71, 30) which measure the space in which a molecule diffuses with a given 
motion type; and (4) the rotational diffusion (58) that depend on the shape and inter-
actions of the diffusing object. These physical parameters give access to the proper-
ties of the followed molecule that diffuses in a given molecular environment. It al-
lows important elements to be characterized such as molecular interactions (e.g. 
receptors with scaffold molecules), or diffusional restriction due to local molecular 
crowding. 
4.9 Transition Between Compartments and Dwell Time  
Within a Compartment 
Special compartments such as synapses can be labelled with fluorescent dyes. Over-
laying the image of a compartment marker with the QD-trajectory allows the transi-
tions of a QD-labelled molecule in and out synapses to be directly observed (7, 30, 
39). Transitions between compartments, dwell time, and the average diffusion coef-
ficient within a compartment can thus be estimated from the trajectory (30). 
 
It is immediately observable from individual trajectories that molecule diffusion 
displays spatial and temporal heterogeneities (Fig. 3). Refining the analysis indicate 
that molecules alternate between states with different diffusional properties follow-
ing Markovian rules. This results either from intrinsic properties of the receptor or 
from reversible interactions with its immediate environment. This was first estab-
lished for glycine receptors using latex beads and optical tweezers (88). Glycine 
receptors diffused in and out of gephyrin clusters with mean residency times of about"

20 s. Interestingly, the distribution of dwell times over clusters followed complex 
kinetics that could not result from a simple bi-molecular interaction. SPT analysis 
with quantum dots provided direct evidence for multiple association states between 
glycine receptors and gephyrin (48). Similar results were found for mGluR (121) or 
AMPAR-stargazin complexes (8) diffusion on homer and PSD-95 clusters respec-
tively. 
 
The cell membrane (i) contains various membrane proteins that can either act as 
traps by transiently immobilizing the diffusing particle or as obstacles by hindering 
its diffusion (70, 93) (ii) contains lipid microdomains, the size of which can range 
from tens to hundreds of nanometers (43), and (iii) is further compartmentalized  
with domains as large as a few hundreds nanometers in diameter (49). This latter ===== Page 14 =====
382"
82,"compartmentalization results from the existence of corrals formed by membrane 
proteins anchored to a submembranous cytoskeleton network. This heterogeneity, 
whether structured or not, dynamic or not, affects the diffusion of proteins in the 
membrane. This heterogeneity can be quantified by a characteristic length below 
which the membrane is homogenous and does not contain any obstacle/trap for the 
diffusing protein. 
 
Properties of diffusion within a compartment are characterized by several pa-
rameters such as the instantaneous diffusion coefficient, the degree of confinement 
and the dwell time. In neurons, the instantaneous diffusion of receptors spans several 
orders of magnitude but is within the same range inside and outside synapses, indi-
cating that receptors can reach comparable slow and high instantaneous speeds in 
both compartments. Yet, the averaged movements are strikingly different in synaptic 
and extrasynaptic domains. Movements in synapses are confined within submicron 
domains while they are free and Brownian outside synapses. As a result, extrasynap-
tic receptors can travel much longer distances. 
4.10 Bulk Versus Single Molecule Measurements 
Although detailed analysis of the trajectories of individual molecules can yield con-
siderably precise information, the representativeness of the measures can always be 
biased by sampling and labeling procedures. Therefore, single molecule data cannot 
be interpreted without knowledge of the population behavior. The most common 
bulk approach to receptor movements is FRAP. Both FRAP and SPT are different 
views of the same phenomenon which is related to the movement and immobiliza-
tion of receptors entering and exiting a defined subdomain. However the interpreta-
tion of FRAP data and extraction of pertinent parameters such as diffusion coeffi-
cients, dwell times and confinement requires multiple and hidden assumptions while 
single molecule tracking directly provides these parameters (63). 
 
FRAP experiments consist of bleaching tagged receptors in a specific region, 
such as the PSD, and measuring the time it takes for unbleached receptors to fill the 
bleached area. The recovery process depends on different molecular events such as 
the lateral diffusion of unbleached receptors into the PSD, which depends on both 
their availability and mobility, and the exit of bleached receptors from the PSD, 
which depends on both their mobility and unbinding from scaffolding molecule. 
The recovery curves depend on different parameters such as the geometrical charac-
teristics of the bleached spot, the flux of incoming receptors in the bleached area, and 
the total number of binding sites. From the recovery curves, two main parameters 
can be recovered, the time constant of recovery and the amount of recovery once 
steady state is reached, otherwise called mobile fraction. 
 
The time constant of recovery depends on the incoming flux which itself depends 
on gradients creating a chemical potential and on the mobility of the molecules. The 
mobile fraction is harder to interpret as it depends on the reservoir of receptors out-
side the bleached zone (e.g. microdomains limit the amount of available receptors) 
and the number of available binding sites in the bleached zone, which itself depend 
on the dissociation kinetics of the bleached receptors from the binding sites. One can 
understand from these considerations that reconciling single molecule and FRAP"

data is not straightforward. Variations of FRAP approaches such as FRAP at varying 
radius (114) or FLIP (fluorescence loss in photobleaching (79)) can however facili-
tate this correlation. 
4.11 The Next Challenge: Live Imaging of Receptor Trafficking in Slices 
Tracking individual receptors in primary neuronal cultures has now been achieved in 
many labs, and all the studies have confirmed the highly dynamic nature of mem-
brane protein organization. However the access to more intact systems (slices and in 
vivo) has resisted single molecule investigations. A few recent reports have analyzed 
the dynamic of synaptic molecules in slices or in vivo using FRAP approach (53). 
Interestingly the dynamics which have been measured are nearly identical to those 
found in culture. Two elements are detrimental to measurements of single molecules 
in tissues: the size of the probe, and the light diffraction which impose large number 
of photons. Further improvements in probe size and quantum yield are likely to al-
low single particle tracking in tissue slices in a foreseeable future. 
5 Diffusion Properties of Neuronal Membranes: Differences  
and Similarities Between Synaptic and Extrasynaptic Membranes 
Neuronal membranes are not homogeneous environments for diffusion and barriers 
to diffusion have been described at several levels. The distribution of proteins, such 
as the neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-gated channels, at the neuronal surface 
is highly compartmentalized. The most striking example of such compartmentaliza-
tion in neurons is between the somatodentritic and axonal compartments. A diffusion 
barrier is present in the cell membrane of the axonal initial segment (AIS), which 
separates the somatodendritic domain and the axon domains. It is formed by the 
accumulation of proteins anchored to the dense membrane skeleton which function 
as rows of pickets, which even stop the overall diffusion of phospholipids (94, 146). 
Neurons control polarized delivery of membrane proteins to each domain, and in 
addition, this diffusion barrier could block diffusion mixing of proteins between 
these domains. At a smaller scale, the synapse is a sub-compartment where neuro-
transmitter receptors are concentrated and confined within the postsynaptic mem-
brane. 
 
Because of the high heterogeneity of the neuronal membrane, that varies in space 
and time, diffusion coefficients of receptors span several orders of magnitude, rang-
ing from the immobile within detection limits (below 10–3 µm2/s) to very mobile  
(1 µm2/s). It is noteworthy that this value is still lower than that expected form a 
transmembrane protein diffusing in a pure lipid bilayer. 
 
Early on, it was recognized that diffusion rates of excitatory and inhibitory recep-
tors varies extensively over time (88, 121), switching often (within seconds) and 
abruptly between states of rapid sow movements as the receptors explored the den-
dritic space. These observations provided additional evidence for the spatial hetero-
geneity of the neuronal membrane and indicated that molecules can exchange be-
tween compartments. Further studies indicated that states of low mobilities were"

preferentially, although not exclusively, associated with the presence of receptors 
over clusters of scaffolding molecules or synaptic sites. An important point to raise is 
that analysis of the exchange of receptors between optically resolved compartments 
is limited by the diffraction limit of visible light used in optical microscopy. As a 
consequence, receptor trajectories can only be ascertained to correspond to an opti-
cally identified compartment with a precision of around 250 nm. Importantly, the 
dynamic signature of movements that is obtained with a sub-diffraction resolution in 
each compartment verifies that receptors diffuse in specific environments. The diffu-
sional properties that characterize a compartment are (1) the distribution of the 
speeds (instantaneous diffusion rate) at which molecules move within the compart-
ment (2) the size of the compartment, (3) the dwell time of the molecule within the 
compartment. The global diffusion rate, averaged over all time intervals and obtained 
by fitting the whole MSD curve instead of the initial slope, provides a mean value of 
receptor diffusion and can be related to the rate of recovery obtained in FRAP ex-
periments. All these parameters are calculated from trajectories and the derived MSD 
function. 
 
To date, most studies have concentrated on the specific diffusional differences 
that exist between synaptic and extrasynaptic domains (3, 30, 39, 47, 56, 133). Gen-
erally speaking, and at first glance, the differences between these two domains ap-
pear surprisingly minor. For AMPARs, the percentage of immobile receptors is only 
about two fold larger in synaptic versus extrasynaptic domains. Similarly, the median 
instantaneous diffusion coefficients are about two fold smaller in synapses. In strik-
ing contrast, the level of confinement is very different in both compartments. While 
receptors display free Brownian diffusion in extrasynaptic domains, traveling several 
microns per minute, they display confined diffusion in synapses, their movement 
being rapid, but restricted to a sub-domain of a few hundreds of nanometer perfectly 
co-localized with synaptic markers (Fig. 3). As a consequence, receptors dwell pro-
portionally for longer times in a synaptic than an extra-synaptic area. These findings 
obtained by single molecule measurements are translated in FRAP experiments by 
slower rates of recovery and a higher immobile fraction in synapses. 
 
Spine shape might be another regulator of receptor diffusion. Spine necks likely 
act as passive filters that help maintaining recycling receptors in the spine head 
(100). In mammalian excitatory neurons, dendritic spines are separated from den-
drites by thin necks. Diffusion across the neck limits the chemical and electrical 
isolation of each spine. The neck also represents a barrier to membrane (111) and 
volume (18) diffusion and these barriers seem to be bi-directionally regulated by 
neuronal activity. Glutamate receptors activation regulates the mobility of molecules 
in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane through an action upon the actin cy-
toskeleton, suggesting a mechanism for the regulation of postsynaptic receptor den-
sity and composition. The regulation of spine/dendrite diffusional equilibration may 
have several functional consequences as the susceptibility of individual synapses to 
plasticity induction may be influenced by the ability of signalling molecules and 
receptors to move into and out of the spine head (3). This reinforces the control of 
the autonomy of the synapses on spines by isolating the spine head as an individual 
diffusion domain (63)."

What might be the biological basis for corralling in synapses? Obviously, intra-
cellular scaffold and cytoskeletal elements, transmembrane adhesion proteins, and 
extracellular matrix are candidates. The differentiating feature between these obsta-
cle molecules lies in whether they act as specific binding sites for the receptors (e.g. 
PSD-95 for stargazin or gephyrin for GlyRs) or participate in overall crowding of the 
synapse acting as posts to slow receptor movements. As for elements participating in 
specific binding, the affinity and avidity of the receptor-target interaction will deter-
mine the residency time of the interaction. When the target is itself immobile, for 
centage of time receptors remain immobile within the PSD. Interestingly, residency 
times of receptors in clusters or synapses, whether AMPARs, mGluRs, GlyRs, or 
GABARs, follow distributions that cannot be fit by monoexponential functions and 
thus very likely do not follow a simple reaction rate kinetic with one bound and one 
unbound state (88, 121). This further suggests that receptor-binder interactions gen-
erate multiple states of distinct stability and could also indicate that receptor sub-
populations move in and out synapses with different rate constants. 
 
The PSD itself is most likely to have a spatially heterogenous structure. Immuno-
electron microscopy has suggested that some molecules display anisotropic colocali-
zation in the PSD. For example the adhesion protein cadherin and mGluR1/5 have 
been reported to lie laterally in the PSD. Classical EM however has a limited label-
ing efficacy, thus questioning the significance of these observations. Recent ad-
vanced cryo-immunoelectron microscopy associated with partial solubilization of 
freeze-fracture replicates (87) has demonstrated a near 100% labeling efficacy (132) 
and has demonstrated a concentration of AMPARs in a few tens of nanometer sized 
within the PSD at most cerebellar synapses, while the remaining ones display diffuse 
staining for AMPARs. Interestingly, high resolution single QD tracking has revealed 
that AMPARs are confined in 50 nm areas at active synapses while they explore the 
whole PSD at silenced synapses (47). Altogether, these data indicate that the PSD 
may bear subdomains in which receptors are more stable than others. In principle, 
these could be linked to presynaptic release sites which may also occur at more spe-
cific sites than previously thought (126). 
6 Receptor Surface Trafficking at Rest: General Rules  
and Subunit Specific Properties 
All neurotransmitter receptors studied so far display some level of lateral diffusion 
and alternate between states of free diffusion, confinement and immobilization  
(Fig. 4). The percentage of time and the properties of each individual state vary con-
siderably from one receptor to the other. Generally speaking, one can assume that the 
state of free diffusion corresponds to receptors unbound from stabilizing elements 
and moving in relatively non-crowded membrane areas, such as the extrasynaptic 
membrane. The state of free diffusion is characterized by a linear MSD indicating 
that the area explored by the receptors increases proportionally with time. The diffu-
sion coefficient of this “freely” diffusive state can however vary sizeably, likely 
proportionally to the size of the diffusing molecular complex that can be affected by  
example if linked to cytoskeletal elements, this interaction time will set the per-"

large intracellular tails or bound scaffold molecules (137). Indeed, freely diffusing 
large complexes are nevertheless slowed down by membrane viscosity. Measured 
values of this state range from very slow to nearly as rapid as that of transmem-
brane proteins in a pure membrane bilayer (diffusion coefficient from less than 
0.005 µm2/s to 1 µm2/s). The confined state corresponds to receptors diffusing in a 
crowded or corralled environment. This state is characterized by the area of the 
confinement domain, the diffusion coefficient, and the residency time within the 
domain. These values are highly variable from one receptor to the other and have 
been reported to range from 20 to 200 nm for domains and 0.005 to 0.1 µm2/s for 
diffusion. Finally, the immobile state corresponds to receptors bound to stabilizing 
elements and is mainly characterized by the residency time in the immobile state. 
We will here summarize the main differences that have been reported between 
receptor subtypes."

6.1 Glutamate Receptors 
In basal conditions, AMPARs diffuse ten to hundred times faster than NMDARs, as 
observed by tracking the movement of GluR1- or GluR2-containing native AMPARs 
versus NR1-containing NMDARs. While basal AMPAR diffusion does not seem to 
depend on subunit composition, NMDARs diffusion strikingly depend on the pres-
ence of NR2A or NR2B subunits (57). While NR2A containing NMDARs are 
largely immobilized at synaptic sites, with only 20% being in a mobile state at any 
given time, NR2B containing NMDARs are rather mobile, albeit at slower rates than 
AMPARs. Triheteromeric NR2A/NR2B/NR1 containing NMDARs likely behave as 
diheteromeric NR2A/NR1 NMDARs (57). The synaptic composition of NMDARs 
changes over maturation with an increase in the NR2A/NR2B subunit ratio (92, 122, 
134, 140). Interestingly, the developmental switch in the synaptic NR2A- and 
NR2B-containing NMDAR surface distribution correlates with developmental 
changes in the time spent by subunits within synapses (54). This suggests that the 
switch in synaptic NMDAR subtypes depends on the regulation of receptor surface 
trafficking. Regarding AMPARs, a global decrease in surface diffusion is observed 
during synaptic development (20, 55), but receptors can still diffuse in and out of 
mature spines (3, 8). 
6.2 Glycine, GABA and Other Receptors 
Using latex beads and SPT, glycine receptors (88) where the first to be shown to be 
mobile in plane of the neuronal plasma membrane and to exchange between clusters 
of gephyrin (its scaffold protein) through lateral diffusion. Quantum dots were used 
to track individual glycine receptors (GlyRs) and to analyze their lateral dynamics in 
the neuronal membrane of living cells for periods ranging from milliseconds to min-
utes (39). This allowed the characterization of multiple diffusion domains in relation 
to the synaptic, perisynaptic, or extrasynaptic GlyR localization. The median diffu-
sion rate in the plane of the plasma membrane was in the range of 10–1–10–2µm2/s in 
the extracellular space, and 10–3 µm2/s or below at synapses. The entry of GlyRs into 
the synapse by diffusion could also be observed and further confirmed by electron 
microscopy imaging of QD-tagged receptors. A careful analysis of the diffusive 
properties further revealed that the receptor scaffold interaction is rather complex 
and results from multiple association states (48). 
 
The dynamics of GABAA receptor mobility between synaptic and extrasynaptic 
locations in hippocampal pyramidal neurons has also been established by FRAP using 
fluorescent GABAA receptors that are capable of binding α-bungarotoxin (Bgt) (19) 
and by introducing a binding site for an irreversible inhibitor into the GABAA receptor 
alpha1 subunit channel lining region that can be accessed only when the receptor is 
activated (135). These studies established that the synaptic receptor population turns 
over rapidly by the import of new functional receptors within minutes through receptor 
diffusion within the plane of the membrane rather than trafficking from intracellular 
pools. Imaging with Bgt in hippocampal neurons revealed that GABAA receptor endo-
cytosis occurred exclusively at extrasynaptic sites, consistent with the preferential 
colocalization of extrasynaptic receptors with the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex."

Receptor insertion into the plasma membrane was also predominantly extrasynaptic, 
and pulse-chase analysis revealed that these newly inserted receptors are then able to 
access directly synaptic sites. These results demonstrate that synaptic GABAA recep-
tors are directly recruited from their extrasynaptic counterparts. 
 
Diffusion of molecules and transient stabilization may also be instrumental to 
create local asymmetry. During the development of the nervous system, the tip of a 
growing axon, the growth cone (GC), must respond accurately to stimuli that direct 
its growth. This axonal navigation depends on extracellular concentration gradients 
of numerous guidance cues, including GABA. GCs can detect even weak directional 
signals, yet the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity remain unclear. Past studies 
in other eukaryotic chemotactic systems have pointed to the role of the spatial reor-
ganization of the transduction pathway in their sensitive response. Using single 
tubules. Moreover, the relocalization was accompanied by an enhancement in the 
asymmetry of intracellular calcium concentration. Altogether, these results revealed 
a microtubule-dependent polarized reorganization of chemoreceptors at the cell sur-
face and suggested that this polarization serves as an amplification step in GABA 
gradient sensing by nerve GCs (22). 
 
The surface diffusion properties of other neuronal receptors have been analyzed 
by ensemble or single molecule dynamic imaging. Using organotypic culture from 
rat striatum transfected with D1R fused to a fluorescent protein, the majority of den-
dritic D1R has been shown to diffuse laterally (118). NMDA receptors can act as a 
scaffold to recruit laterally diffusing dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) to neuronal 
spines. Human mu opiod receptors have been shown to diffuse in permeable sub-
micrometer sized domains (40, 116). The cell surface dynamics of the 5HT1A recep-
tor is modulated in a G protein-dependent manner (107). The movement of the hu-
man odorant receptor OR17-40 has been monitored in living cells by ensemble and 
single-molecule imaging. Although mobile receptors initially diffused either freely 
or within domains of various sizes, binding of an agonist or an antagonist increased 
partitioning of receptors into small domains of approximately 190 nm, which likely 
are precursors of clathrin-coated pits (66). 
7 Receptor Scaffold Interactions and Cytoskeleton as Key 
Determinants of Surface Trafficking 
Synapses contain over 300 types of proteins (65, 103), including neurotransmitter 
receptors, adhesion proteins and intracellular scaffolding, cytoskeleton or signaling 
elements. These various proteins can bind one with the other following a complex set 
of interactions that is far from worked out. These interactions can regulate the stabi-
lization, function or trafficking of receptors and a number of them have been shown 
to regulate receptor surface diffusion and exchange between synaptic and extra-
synaptic sites (Figs. 5,and 6).

in the plasma membrane of nerve GCs subjected to directional stimuli. In the pres-
ence of an external GABA gradient GABAARs redistributed asymmetrically across 
the GC toward the gradient source. Single-particle tracking of GABAARs showed 
that the redistribution resulted from transient interactions between receptors and micro-"

The fast reversibility of receptor-scaffold interactions were first demonstrated in 
live neurons using single latex particle tracking both for the glycine recep-
tor/gephyrin interaction (88) and the group I metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 
(mGluR5)/Homer interaction (121). Single-particle tracking was used to follow in 
real time, movements of the glycine receptor (GlyR) on the cell surface with or with-
out the GlyR stabilizing protein gephyrin. GlyR alternate within seconds between 
diffusive and confined states. In the absence of gephyrin, GlyRs are mostly freely 
diffusing. Gephyrin induced long confinement periods spatially associated with 
submembranous clusters of gephyrin. However, even when most receptors are stabi-
lized, they still frequently make transitions to the diffusive state. Analysis of the 
diffusion properties of two GlyR subunit types, either able or unable to bind gephy-
rin, gave access to the association states of GlyRs with its scaffolding protein (48). 
This indicated that an important portion of GlyR could be linked to a few molecules 
of gephyrin outside gephyrin clusters. The presence of extrasynaptic GlyR-gephyrin

complexes may be formed outside (equilibrium 1) or inside (equilibrium 4) gephyrin clusters.

complexes is not a surprise since the receptor associates with gephyrin intracellu-
larly, and this insertion increases its plasma membrane accumulation rate (60). This 
emphasizes the role of scaffolding proteins in the extrasynaptic membrane and sup-
ports the implication of gephyrin-gephyrin interactions in the stabilization of GlyR at 
synapses. 
 
The kinetic parameters controlling the equilibrium between GlyR inside and 
outside clusters were also characterized, and even within clusters, two subpopula-
tions of GlyR with distinct degrees of stabilization between receptors and scaffolding 
proteins could be identified. At present, these subpopulations cannot be ascribed to 
specific molecular entities. At excitatory synapses, the receptor scaffold interaction 
is also a complex matter. mGluR5 is concentrated in a domain around the postsynap-"

tic density but also found in large amounts in the extrasynaptic membrane (9, 97, 
144). Receptor activation by glutamate increases receptor diffusion, whereas the 
scaffolding protein Homer favours confinement of receptor movements within clus-
ters of Homer-mGluR5. However, this stabilization is reversible, because even in the 
presence of Homer, receptors still enter and exit from clusters at fast rates. Further-
more, clusters themselves are highly dynamic both in their movements and in their 
composition, which can vary within tens of seconds. These results first demonstrated 
that the exchange of receptors between dispersed and clustered states is fast and 
regulated during physiological processes and that receptor number in a cluster results 
from a dynamic equilibrium between the pools of stabilized and freely mobile recep-
tors. This suggested that modification of this equilibrium could be involved in regu-
lation of the number of receptors at synapses and may explain certain fast changes in 
receptor composition. 
 
More recently, AMPAR stabilization at excitatory synapses has been shown to be 
mediated by interactions with the AMPAR-associated protein stargazin (95, 149) via 
the PDZ-domain scaffold protein PSD-95 (8). Using single quantum dot imaging and 
FRAP in live hippocampal neurons, AMPARs were shown to diffuse in the neuronal 
membrane together with Stargazin and to be trapped reversibly at synapses through 
the specific binding of stargazin to PSD-95 (Fig. 5). Disruption of the interaction 
between stargazin and PSD-95 strongly increased AMPAR surface diffusion, remov-
ing AMPARs from postsynaptic sites. Interestingly, and in contrast, the C-terminal 
domain of GluR2 does not seem to be involved in controlling AMPAR lateral diffu-
sion. The direct interaction of the GluR2 C-terminus with the PDZ-containing pro-
teins ABP/GRIP and PICK1 has been shown to play an important role in the regula-
tion of AMPARs expression at synaptic sites (reviewed in (35)). These proteins may 
be involved primarily in modulating the surface expression of AMPARs rather than 
anchoring them at synaptic sites. The GluR2 PDZ-binding motif could be either 
required for AMPAR retention in plasma membrane (99) or for receptor recycling at 
the surface (102). 
 
Cytoskeletal elements have also been shown to control receptor diffusion (30). 
Pharmacological disruption of F-actin and microtubules decreases the amount of 
GlyR and gephyrin, the backbone of the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold, at syn-
apses. F-actin and microtubule disruption increases GlyR exchange between the 
synaptic and extrasynaptic membranes and decreases receptor dwell time at synapses 
(Fig. 7). GlyR lateral diffusion is predominantly controlled by microtubules in the 
extrasynaptic membrane and by actin at synapses. Both diffusion coefficients and 
confinement at synapses are affected after F-actin disruption. These results indicate 
that receptor exchange between synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments depends on 
the properties of both the postsynaptic specialization and the extrasynaptic mem-
brane. Consequently, GlyR number at synapses may be rapidly modulated by the 
cytoskeleton through the regulation of lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane and 
of receptor stabilization at synapses. In fact, the receptor is not diffusing above a 
stable matrix of gephyrins, and the postsynaptic scaffolds display a submicrometric 
rapid lateral motion continuously moving on the dendritic shaft (59). This dynamic"

8 Receptor Surface Trafficking and Synaptic Plasticity 
Rapid or long-term modifications in the efficacy of synaptic transmission are re-
ferred to as processes of synaptic plasticity. These are observed during development 
(synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation) and in the adult. In the last decade, activ-
ity-dependent synaptic plasticity has been shown to rely in large part on changes in 
the number and subtype of receptors concentrated in synapses (reviewed in (42, 54, 
80, 85)). Surface diffusion of receptors in and out synaptic sites has emerged as a 
major mechanism to control these changes and this has fostered the analysis of activ-
ity-dependent regulation of receptor lateral diffusion (31, 142). 
 
Although this field is only in its infancy, it is becoming apparent that both excita-
tory and inhibitory receptor diffusion is strongly and tightly regulated. It was initially 
shown that local rises in intracellular calcium or glutamate uncaging induce a rapid 
and reversible immobilization of AMPARs associated with a local accumulation of 
receptors (20). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are 
still unclear, this is likely an important process to locally stabilize AMPARs during 
activity dependent processes. In contrast, global neuronal depolarization or bath 
application of glutamate induce an increase in AMPAR mobility (56, 133). This 
could underlie the loss of synaptic receptors observed during synaptic depression, 
although this remains to be established. 
 
Basal synaptic activity was also recently shown to regulate AMPAR accumula-
tion at synapses (47). Using single-molecule tracking together with the selective 
silencing of individual presynaptic boutons, local synaptic activity was shown to 
reduce diffusional exchange of GluR1 between synaptic and extrasynaptic domains, 
resulting in the postsynaptic accumulation of GluR1 (Fig. 8). At neighboring inactive 
synapses, GluR1 is highly mobile with individual receptors frequently escaping the 
synapse. Within the synapse, spontaneous activity confines the small-scale diffu-
sional movement of GluR1 to restricted subregions of the postsynaptic membrane. 
Thus, local activity restricts GluR1 diffusional mobility on a submicron scale, defin-
ing a novel input-specific mechanism for regulating AMPA receptor composition 
and abundance. 
 
The molecular mechanisms underlying short- or long-term activity-dependent 
regulation of AMPARs surface trafficking are still unknown but most likely involve 
regulation of interactions between the AMPAR/TARP complex and intracellular 
scaffold proteins. The C-termini of GluR1 and GluR2 have both been extensively 
shown to be involved in activity-dependent regulation of AMPAR numbers at syn-
apses (reviewed in (35, 149)). Alternatively, phosphorylation of the C-terminus of 
TARPs has been shown to bi-directionally regulate synaptic plasticity (138). Deci-
phering the respective roles of AMPARs and TARPs in synaptic plasticity will un-
doubtedly require analyzing their differential involvement in the various trafficking 
pathways (lateral diffusion versus recycling) to and from the synapse."

9 Concepts Which Have Emerged from Single Molecule Imaging 
in Neuroscience 
9.1 New Imaging Technologies Together with Single Channel Recordings 
Have Favoured the Emergence of Molecular Physiology 
Technological developments have allowed the investigation of dynamic processes 
which are hidden by the averaging inherent to bulk experiments. Numerous physical 
parameters are only accessible through nonstationary dynamics such as forward and 
scaffold proteins) enter and exit synapses at rates much higher than previously 
thought. This leads to the concept that synapses are multimolecular assemblies 
whose components are in a dynamic equilibrium with the reserve pools of molecules 
in the extrasynaptic membrane and in intracellular compartments (Figs. 6 and 9). The 
new concept is that synaptic plasticity results from changes in the equilibrium set 
points rather than all or none addition or removal of receptors. Equilibrium set points 
are likely to be part of a continuum rather than representing discrete states. The mo-
lecular basis for the changes in set points likely lies at several levels such as of re-
ceptor/scaffold affinities, flux rate of molecules, as well as their absolute levels of 
expression. In any case, the transition between equilibrium states relies on diffusion 
of molecules (including receptors and scaffold proteins) in and out synapses and the 
characteristic residence time of individual molecules or molecular assemblies in 
specific subcellular compartments. Diffusion provides a rapid sorting mechanism as 
already postulated for other cellular systems. Given the size of PSDs (diameter 
around 300 nm), the density of synapses (about 1 per µm2), and the diffusion coeffi-
cients measured in the synaptic and extrasynaptic compartment, reasonable assump-
tions allow one to estimate the time needed for a receptor to exit (100 msec) or en-
counter a synapse (in the order of the minute) (63). This scale difference results from 
the large ratio of extrasynaptic to synaptic surface. Interestingly at excitatory syn-
apses, local delivery of receptors to the spine head (101) which itself constitute a 
confined space, may allow an increase of the probability of diffusing receptors to be 
trapped by the PSD. Changes in the shape of spines may regulate this trapping effi-
ciency (3). 
 
That molecules only reside transiently in synapses implies that the molecular 
interactions underlying their stabilization are reversible over a short time scale. Time 
resolved measurements indicate that receptor exchange between the outside and 
inside of the PSD results from multiple kinetic pathways. This suggests multiple 
association states between receptors and scaffolding molecules as described above 
for the GlyR-gephyrin interaction (48). In a minimal model, these states can be de-
fined as bound synaptic, bound extrasynaptic, superbound, etc. The latter state corre-
sponds to receptors which stay for a long period (>30 s) and a higher confinement. 
Allocating the different states to identified structural features and determining the on 
and off rates between the states will allow access to the molecular biochemistry of 
receptor binding to scaffolding proteins and scaffolding proteins binding to other 
scaffolding proteins in living cells.

Thus, from a general view point, probing molecular interactions in living neurons 
will be of utmost importance. It is of particular interest to go beyond in vitro (i.e. in a 
test tube) studies which cannot take into account biochemical and biophysical prop-
erties due to the two dimensional nature of the membrane, inhomogeneities of pro-
tein concentrations or interfering interactions with other molecules such as lipids. 
The advent of single molecule and FRET techniques in live cells now provides a way 
to study in situ biochemical reactions. Such powerful tools will allow for a more 
complete deciphering of the kinetic properties of biological assemblies in relation to 
pharmacological properties.

9.2 Adaptation and Formation of Synapses 
Another major outcome of the proposed model is that it accounts for changes during 
synaptic plasticity or even during synapse formation, which may result from modifi-
cations of receptor concentration in the plasma membrane and/or from changes in the 
concentration of scaffold proteins in the cytosol. It explains how changes in concen-
trations, i.e. chemical potentials, of receptors and scaffolds, lead to new steady state 
of the postsynaptic molecular assembly: the cooperativity at the origin of the discon-
tinuous change of density distributions allows the system to switch from one set 
point of equilibrium to another one by small changes of key parameters. These 
chemical kinetics will need to be reconciled with specific biological mechanisms. 
This can now be achieved because the behaviour of individual molecules can be 
monitored, therefore allowing access to mechanisms normally hidden in the convo-
luted statistics of the behaviour of large numbers of molecules. 
9.3 Reconciling Component Turnover and Synapse Structure Stability at 
Steady State 
Stability of the synaptic structure in light of mobile receptors is a complex matter, 
because the local turnover (at synapses) of constitutive elements of the synapse is 
shorter than the lifetime of the structure (the synapse) (123). Recently, a new model 
has been proposed (125) in which the stability of receptor density is compatible with 
receptor individual turnover (Fig. 9). It accounts for the key idea that molecular 
interactions and cooperativity can be at the origin of a metastability of clusters and 
that their lifetime could be several orders of magnitude larger than that of their con-
stitutive molecules. This quasi-equilibrium maintaining a stable density of receptor is 
also shared by our model. 
 
The question of how much time an individual receptor spends in the synaptic 
zone is an important issue (Fig. 9). At steady state, the fraction of time spent by a 
particular receptor on a particular synaptic contact should be proportional to the 
density of the receptors at the contact. This is true if every receptor is well mixed so 
that there are no separation between the permanently stagnant receptors and mobile 
receptors. However, if some receptors are immobilized irreversibly (superbound) 
within the synaptic zone, the model can be modified to incorporate the contribution 
of these receptors. In order to test the hypothesis of mixing using single particle 
tracking, care must be taken so that the ensemble of trajectories tracked are not bi-
ased: if only those receptors which are initially diffusing in the extrasynaptic zone 
are sampled, then the statistics will be biased because of undetected receptors which 
stay within a synaptic site throughout the tracking experiment. Single-particle-
tracking measurement has established at central excitatory synapses that about half 
of the receptors are mobile (39, 133). In contrast, FRAP (fluorescence recovery after 
photo-breaching) experiments of glutamate receptors at Drosophila neuromuscular 
junctions suggests that they are immobilized once they enter into the postsynaptic 
domain (109). However, one should stress that the stabilization of receptor density in 
the synaptic zone with indefinite lifetime is compatible with a finite residence time 
of an individual receptor on a synaptic site. Recently, Fusi et al. proposed a cascade"

mechanism to generate different timescales of synaptically stored memories (50), 
which sheds light on the quasi-equilibrium approach that we propose. Actually, dif-
ferent timescales can coexist to account for the dynamic turnover of constituting 
molecules in the postsynaptic density. 
 
Another concept, which arises from the present model, is that stabilization is a 
reciprocal and cooperative mechanism. In other words, scaffold proteins stabilize 
receptors, and receptors stabilize scaffold proteins. This means that the local turnover 
of a given protein is not likely to determine by itself the turnover of the structure (see 
above). Indeed, the characteristic time of the individual molecule is independent 
from that of the structure, but one should also consider the molecular interactions. In 
biological terms, scaffolding molecules are not stabilizing the structure because they 
would have a longer turnover in the structure. Actually, reciprocity can either attenu-
ate or amplify the amplitude of stochastic fluctuations of the receptor numbers at 
each synaptic site, depending on phase matching and consequently at the origin of a 
phase locking by reciprocity. This introduces robustness against the fluctuations of 
total receptor number associated with exo-/endocytosis at extrasynaptic sites. 
10 Conclusion 
Do receptor movements also exist in vivo in the freely behaving animal? This is a 
technical challenge. However in slices, FRAP experiments have revealed that cell 
surface receptors such as AMPAR and NMDAR also display diffusive behaviors. 
The basic biophysical properties of membranes have no reason to be fundamentally 
different from those characterized in cultured cells. Until now, nobody has chal-
lenged the fluid mosaic membrane model (127) in vivo. Nevertheless, extracellular 
and intercellular environments are likely different in vivo than in vitro and thus may 
impose supplementary constraints on receptor diffusion. These measurements repre-
sent the next frontier in this field.

1 Introduction 
Many intractable neurological and mental diseases, including epilepsy, depression, 
and schizophrenia, are believed to result, in part, from derangements of regulation of 
synaptic transmission in the brain. For this reason, much effort has been made to 
discover how the delicate mechanisms of signal transduction at synapses lead to 
modification of synaptic strength. One fruitful area of research over the last twenty 
years has been the postsynaptic signaling apparatus in glutamatergic spines (8, 97, 
99, 106). Spines contain clusters of receptors and signaling proteins located in a 
dense submembranous structure that can be seen in the electron microscope and is 
called the postsynaptic density or PSD (For review of early work see 98). 
In the 1970’s, Philip Siekevitz (40) and Carl Cotman (42) worked out subcellular 
fractionation methods to purify tiny disks from brain that contain many of the pro-
teins that are most tightly bound to the PSD. Their purification methods were later 
used to obtain material from which several ubiquitous PSD proteins were identified 
and sequenced, including the prototypical scaffold protein, PSD-95 (37, 109, 113), 
synGAP (35), the shank/proSAP family (20), and densin (6). At the same time, and 
independently, some of these proteins, and additional new ones from the PSD frac-
tion, were identified by their interactions in yeast two hybrid screens, including 
GKAP (104), synGAP (107), shank/proSAP (158), and homer (24). Continuing 
proteomic analyses of the PSD fraction or related “NMDA-receptor complexes” (89, 
127, 177, 235) have produced a catalog of putative PSD-associated proteins that 
comprises a few hundred individual proteins. More recent studies have begun to 
address the crucial question of the relative abundance of each protein in the PSD 
fraction and their stoichiometric ratios (126, 127, 177). 
 
However, we are still in the early stages of understanding which core protein 
complexes are present in most excitatory synapses, and which proteins are present 
only in a subset of synapses, perhaps conferring specialized properties.

and a GK-domain. The figure includes one example of the GRIP/APB family, GRIP, which 
has six PDZ domains; one example of the shank/proSAP family, shank-1; and two examples

tures for the other families are less well understood. TARPs (320 to 420 residues in length) 
3 Scaffold Proteins Associated with the NMDA Receptor 
The NMDA-type glutamate receptor (see Chapter by Traynelis et al.) is a ligand-gated Ca2+-
permeable ion channel that plays a critical role in several forms of synaptic plasticity, includ-
ing long-term potentiation and long-term depression. It is a tetramer comprised of a pair of 
NR1 subunits and a pair of NR2 subunits. The NR2 subunits have unusually long cytosolic 
tails of 500 to 600 amino acids. These tails extend into the cytosol and interact with a variety 
of scaffold proteins and signaling enzymes. Of the four known NR2 subunits, NR2A and 
NR2B are the most abundant in forebrain neurons where the protein interactions of the tails 
have been most thoroughly studied. Individual receptors in forebrain neurons can contain two 
copies of NR2A, two of NR2B, or one copy of each (50, 86, 147, 148). 
contain four transmembrane domains and are homologous to γ-subunits of Ca2+ channels. The 
domain structures of GKAPs (666 residues in length) and of the tails of the NR2 subunits of 
the NMDA receptor (approx. 600 residues in length) are not yet well understood."

hypothetical structures of protein complexes are overlaid to scale on an electron micrograph of 
a glutamatergic postsynaptic density (~450 nm in length) from the hippocampus. Light blue 
and red orange proteins represent NMDA and AMPA receptors, respectively. The hypothetical 
structures of the receptors were assembled as described in (150) from X-ray structures of the 
ATD domain of mGluR1 (1EWV), the ligand binding core complex of NR1/NR2A (2A5T), 
and the KcsA channel (POA334). The tails of the two NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor 
are completely fictional as no information is available about their structures; however, the 
cartoon structure is drawn approximately to scale to depict the length of the tails with respect 
to the rest of the receptor. The aqua structure represents PSD-95 assembled from X-ray struc-
tures of its various domains (1IU2, 1QLC, 1BE9, and 1TP5). The domains have been slightly 
separated for clarity; the actual structure is likely more compact then shown here (see 114). 
The green protein represents synGAP; the GAP domain is that of p120rasGAP (1WER); other 
domains of synGAP with uncertain structures are depicted as beaded strings. The magenta 
proteins represent two different versions of the structure of the CaMKII holoenzyme. The flat, 
disk-shaped structure is based on the X-ray structure of Rosenberg et al. (192) and represents 
CaMKII in its inactive form. The open, crown-like structure is a lower resolution structure 
obtained by cryo-electron microscopy (see 112). This structure may represent CaMKII in its 
fully active form. The gold elongated proteins represent multimers of members of the 
shank/proSAP family. The amino terminal ankyrin repeats, SH3 domain, and PDZ domain are 
constructed from homologous X-ray structures of similar domains in other proteins (2PNN,"

3.1 The PSD-95 Family 
PSD-95 (also known as SAP90) was first identified as an abundant component of the 
PSD (37, 109). The first hint that it might be a scaffold protein came from the pres-
ence in its sequence of three repeated 90 residue domains and an SH3 domain. A 
fifth domain, now called a GK-domain (guanylate kinase-like) was at first thought to 
have an enzymatic function; but it has been shown to be enzymatically silent and 
instead to act as a protein-binding domain (104, 108). The three repeated domains 
are now called PDZ domains. Indeed, PDZ domains were first defined in PSD-95 
(37, 113). A PDZ domain is a consensus protein-binding motif that is found in a 
wide variety of membrane-associated proteins. They bind specific sequences (e.g. a 
“tSXV motif”) that are usually located at the carboxyl terminus of a membrane pro-
tein (114, 164) or they can associate through PDZ-PDZ interactions (164). In 
NMDARs, the C-terminal consensus sequence S-I/L-E-S-D/E-V in NR2 subunits 
binds to the first and second PDZ domains of PSD-95 (113). This tSXV motif can 
also bind to the corresponding PDZ domains of the other MAGUKs, SAP97, PSD-
93, and SAP102. The PDZ domains of the PSD-95 family are relatively promiscuous 
“multifunctional” scaffold proteins. It is still not fully understood how the precise 
associations of PSD-95 and the other MAGUKs are controlled inside cells in situa-
tions when many binding partners are available. 
Overexpression of PSD-95 family proteins, NMDARs, or other target proteins in 
heterologous cells induces their clustering (103). Studies of NMDARs expressed 
with PSD-95 in Xenopus oocytes suggest that PSD-95 can also modulate surface 
expression and biophysical properties of NMDARs (131, 252). These findings were 
interpreted to mean that PSD-95 might be important for insertion into the plasma 
membrane and postsynaptic clustering of NMDARs. However, mutant mice in which 
the first and second PDZ domains of PSD-95 are deleted have normal levels of sur-
face synaptic NMDARs (154). They do, however display abnormal synaptic plastic-
ity, suggesting that the crucial role of PSD-95 is organization of signaling machinery 
near the NMDAR. 
Interestingly, PSD-95 and its homologues play a role in targeting of AMPA re-
ceptors to synapses in hippocampal neurons (36, 122, 199) (see below). When both 
PSD-95 and PSD-93 are deleted, AMPA-receptor trafficking, but not NMDAR traf-
ficking, is altered in many synapses (12, 59). Taken together these data suggest that

PSD-95 may be important for control of AMPA receptor trafficking; but its role in 
relation to NMDA receptors is more complex. The interaction between the NMDAR 
and PSD-95 appears to be important for proper alignment and interaction of signaling 
proteins within the spine but it is not crucial for NMDAR clustering at the synapse. 
3.1.1 Complexes Formed by PSD-95  
The PDZ domains of PSD-95 have been shown to bind to several proteins that are 
located in spines. However, it is still not known which of these associations actually 
occurs in vivo. Nor is it clear whether a particular set of associations predominates in 
the spine, or whether the range of associations shifts depending on regulatory cues. 
The first and second PDZ domains of PSD-95 can bind to the cytosolic carboxyl 
termini of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB4 (71, 88), semaphorin adhesion proteins 
(31, 201), the tails of shaker-type voltage-gated K+ channels (105), and several in-
wardly rectifying potassium channels (161). The third PDZ domain binds the postsy-
naptic adhesion protein neuroligin (91, 212) and thus influences synaptic develop-
ment (185) and retrograde signaling (69). It also can bind to synGAP and kalirin7, 
both of which influence signaling through small GTPases. Like EphB2, PSD-95 can 
bind to Src-family kinases and thus may localize and/or regulate them in the PSD 
(93, 94, 224). 
One important role for PSD-95 is as a scaffold for Ca2+-activated signaling enzymes, 
placing them in proximity to Ca2+ flowing through the NMDAR and, thus, forming a 
signaling module whose activity is spatially and temporally restricted (64, 97). PSD-
95 can bind to neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) through an atypical interaction 
with the first and second PDZ domains (27, 38) and to synGAP, an abundant ras-
GTPase activating protein in the PSD fraction, through the third PDZ domain (35, 
107). Both nNOS and synGAP are regulated by Ca2+ entry through the NMDAR (38, 
167). 
3.1.3 Small GTPases  
PSD-95 has been reported to bind to several regulators of small GTPase proteins, 
including synGAP (35, 107), kalirin7 (179), SPAR (174), and citron (259), suggest-
ing that it may play a significant role in the orchestration of GTPase signaling in the 
postsynaptic spine. 
SynGAP is a ras and rap GTPase that is concentrated in the PSD presumably by 
virtue of its interaction with the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 (35, 116). Its GAP 
activity would be expected to increase the rate of inactivation of ras that has been 
activated by rasGRF (see below), or by postsynaptic TrkB receptors stimulated by 
BDNF. This activity is enhanced by phosphorylation by CaMKII that is activated by 
stimulation of NMDARs (167). Deletion of the synGAP gene is lethal in mice a few 
days after birth, indicating that it is a particularly crucial regulatory protein (110, 
111, 234). Mice heterozygous for the synGAP deletion have behavioral learning

deficits and defects in generation of LTP (111). Neurons cultured from mouse em-
bryos homozygous for the synGAP deletion show derangements in cytoskeletal 
regulation (234) and in AMPA receptor trafficking (116, 192). The association of 
synGAP with PSD-95 is important for regulation of the cytoskeleton, as evidenced 
by the fact that a mutant synGAP protein with a deletion of its tSXV domain cannot 
rescue the cytoskeletal defects (234). Taken together, these studies suggest that PSD-
95 is important for proper coordination of signaling through small GTPases in the 
PSD. 
Kalirin7, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rho family of small 
GTPases, associates with the third PDZ domain of PSD-95. By virtue of this associa-
tion, PSD-95 may help to coordinate regulation by EphB2 of spine morphology and 
NMDA receptor current. Kalirin7 has been shown to regulate formation and mainte-
nance of dendrites and spines during development (138, 179, 180, 187). When it is 
activated by binding of ephrin to the EphB2 receptor, kalirin7 activates Rac which 
then activates PAK1, an enzyme that controls the actin cytoskeleton. During devel-
opment, activation of PAK1 in dendrites leads to formation of mature dendritic 
spines (178). Activation of EphB2 also triggers an independent structural rearrange-
ment by promoting association between EphB2 itself and the NR1 subunit of the 
NMDAR (45), as well as, with postsynaptic PDZ domain-containing scaffold pro-
teins such as GRIP/ABP (51, 215) and PICK1 (227). In this way, activated EphB2 is 
recruited to the postsynaptic membrane. There it, in turn, recruits and activates 
members of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases which phosphorylate 
NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor, resulting in an increase in conductance of Ca2+ 
upon glutamate stimulation (221, 237, 256). 
The GK-domain of PSD-95 can bind directly to a spine-associated Rap-GAP 
termed SPAR and recruit it into the NMDAR complex. SPAR also binds to actin and 
contributes to regulation of the actin cytoskeleton of the spine by down-regulating 
the activity of Rap (174). It also acts as a scaffold through its association with the 
master scaffold protein shank/proSAP (discussed below) via an intermediate protein 
(proSAPiP1) (241). 
Finally, the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 can associate with citron-N, a splice 
variant of citron-kinase that lacks the kinase domain, and is situated in neuronal cell 
bodies, as well as concentrated at glutamatergic synapses in inhibitory neurons in the 
hippocampus and cortex and excitatory neurons in the thalamus and basal ganglia 
(68, 258, 259). Citron-N is a target of activated Rho and participates in organization 
of the Golgi apparatus in neurons (32). It binds to the Golgi apparatus, and controls 
actin filaments locally by assembling a complex of the Rho effector ROCK-II and 
the neuron-specific actin-binding protein profilin-IIa. The precise role of citron-N at 
synapses is still unknown. However, mutations in the gene encoding citron were 
recently implicated in genetic predisposition toward affective disorders (137). 
3.1.4 AMPA Receptors  
As we will discuss in a later section, the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and its homologues, 
including SAP97 can associate with complexes surrounding AMPA receptors."

3.1.5 The Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) Domain and Linkage to the Shank/proSAP 
Scaffold  
The C-terminal GK-domain of PSD-95 and its homologues also acts as a specific 
protein interaction site. One important family of PSD proteins called GK-associated 
proteins (GKAPs) (104, 198, 222) bind to the GK-domain and link the PSD-95 scaf-
fold to members of the shank/proSAP family (21, 158). Shank proteins are large 
scaffold proteins that contain a series of protein interaction motifs and lack identified 
catalytic domains. The single PDZ domain of shank binds to the C-terminus of 
GKAP. Shank proteins interact with a series of other scaffold proteins linking to-
gether protein complexes associated with all three major classes of glutamate  
receptors. 
The protein kinase scaffold AKAP-79/150 binds to the SH3 and GK-domains of 
PSD-95 or SAP97 (41). AKAP-79/150 contains binding sites for cAMP-dependent 
protein kinase, C-kinase, and the Ca2+-regulated phosphatase, calcineurin. Its asso-
ciation with MAGUKs may help to properly position these enzymes near the postsy-
naptic membrane. 
How and when each of these possible complexes is formed at different synapses, 
and how they are regulated, are subjects for future study. 
3.1.6 Dynamics of Association of PSD-95 with the PSD  
Because PSD-95 and the other MAGUK proteins are capable of a large number of 
high affinity associations with synaptic proteins, it is easy to imagine that individual 
PSD-95 proteins remain stably bound within a particular PSD once they arrive there. 
However, one study of tagged PSD-95 proteins in vivo reveals quite a different situa-
tion. Although the size of individual PSDs is generally stable, individual PSD-95 
proteins exist in a dynamic equilibrium moving rapidly among neighboring spines 
with an average retention time in a single spine of 1–2 hr (78). The behavior suggests 
that individual spines compete for limiting amounts of PSD-95 and that larger PSDs 
contain more PSD-95 binding sites. This rapid dynamic equilibrium may permit 
correspondingly rapid remodeling of individual PSDs in response to biochemical 
changes in PSD-95 binding proteins triggered by synaptic activity. 
Structural studies of PSD-95 itself suggest possible regulatory mechanisms that 
could control the availability of its binding sites. The SH3 domain of PSD-95 inter-
acts intimately with the GK domain such that a portion of the GK domain is neces-
sary to complete the SH3 fold (149, 150, 223). Point mutations that disrupt the inter-
action between the two domains interfere with the ability of PSD-95 to cluster 
potassium channels in heterologous cells, suggesting the conformation and/or avail-
ability of PDZ domains has been altered (209). Furthermore, patch analysis of the 
tertiary structure of PSD-95 suggests that it can exist in two distinct stable conforma-
tions; one that obscures the binding cleft of the third PDZ domain and another that 
exposes it (112). Future studies of regulation of the conformation of PSD-95 may 
reveal new mechanisms that contribute to control and remodeling of signaling com-
plexes in the spine."

3.2 Direct Association of Signaling Proteins with the Tails of NMDA 
Receptor Subunits 
The structure of the NMDA receptor is unusual in several ways. One of its most 
striking structural features is the extended carboxyl termini of the NR2 subunits. 
These tails comprise approximately 600 residues and extend into the cytosol where 
they interact with PSD-95 (113); but also bind directly to the signaling enzymes 
CaMKII (11) and rasGRFI (115). The tails can also associate with the actin-
associated protein, α-actinin (248), and the scaffold protein yotiao which binds pro-
tein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein kinase A (PKA) (242). Thus, these tails appear 
to serve a scaffolding function of their own that helps to arrange the NMDA receptor 
signaling complex. 
3.2.1 CaMKII  
The most thoroughly studied enzyme that binds to the tail of NR2 subunits is 
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (14, 190). It is one of several 
critical determinants of synaptic plasticity that are activated by influx of Ca2+ 
CaMKII has an elaborate structure. Individual catalytic subunits are activated by 
the Ca2+-bound form of calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM), which binds to a single CaM-
binding domain within each subunit, and in so doing opens up the catalytic site so 
that it is able to interact with substrate proteins (14, 15, 176). The catalytic subunits 
assemble into a large holoenzyme made up of 12 catalytic units held together by 
interactions among association domains in the carboxyl third of their sequence (14, 
189, 190). The holoenzymes are randomly assembled from two closely related cata-
lytic subunits termed α and β (14, 29, 100). In the forebrain, α-subunits predominate 
over β-subunits by a ratio of 3 to 1. When all of the subunits are in an inactive state, 
the holoenzyme takes the form of six dimers because individual pairs of catalytic 
subunits bind to each other by a coiled coil interaction between their calmodulin 
binding domains (190). Activation of subunits by binding of Ca2+/CaM is accompa-
nied by autophosphorylation of a key residue in each subunit, threonine-286. Phos-
phorylation of this site prevents the catalytic site from closing when CaM later disso-
ciates; thus, it holds the subunit in an active conformation (155). In order for this 
autophosphorylation to occur, Ca2+/CaM must be bound to two neighboring subunits, 
one that acts as the “kinase” and a second that acts as the “substrate” (79). Based on 
their crystal structure, Rosenberg et al. (190) proposed that binding of Ca2+/CaM 
dissociates the members of an inactive dimer pair, exposing their active sites and 
permitting autophosphorylation to occur between them. 
CaMKII is an abundant constituent of the PSD fraction (101) which implies that 
the PSD contains many sites at which it can bind. In turn, each holoenzyme likely 
contains at least 12 possible sites that could bind to docking proteins in the PSD. 
CaMKII is an abundant protein in the forebrain, constituting ~ 1–2% of the total 
protein content (60). Therefore, it is likely to be present in excess of its individual 
binding sites in the PSD. At least three proteins in the PSD have been identified as 
through the NMDAR (65, 99, 132, 193, 261). Its positioning near the NMDAR 
would place it in an ideal location to influence synaptic plasticity."

M.B. Kennedy et al. 
 
potential docking sites for CaMKII; the tails of the NR2 subunits of the NMDA 
receptor, the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, and densin, a sialylated trans-
membrane protein that has a short cytosolic domain and is highly enriched in the 
PSD (6). Three other proteins located near the PSD also bind CaMKII. α-actinin 
binds to CaMKII directly and forms a stable ternary complex with CaMKII and 
densin (236), and also with CaMKII and NR2B (121). F-actin, which makes up the 
spine cytoskeleton, binds the less abundant β-subunit of CaMKII, but does not bind 
the more abundant α-subunit (168, 205). Finally, the PDZ-domain-containing scaf-
fold protein MUPP-1 has been reported to bind directly to CaMKII (116). The best 
studied of all of these potential interactions is the one with the tails of the NR2A and 
NR2B subunits. 
The two most prominent NR2 subunits in the forebrain, NR2A and NR2B, both 
bind CaMKII at sites located in their long cytosolic carboxyl termini (73, 123, 216). 
Binding to either one requires activation of CaMKII by Ca2+/CaM; however, the 
binding sites in NR2A and NR2B are not identical. The tail of NR2B binds CaMKII 
with high affinity at two distinct sites (11, 217); a site distal to the membrane (resi-
dues 1259–1310) that requires binding of Ca2+/CaM to CaMKII, and a more proxi-
mal site (residues 829–1120) that only binds CaMKII after autophosphorylation at 
Thr286 (11, 200). Binding to the distal site stabilizes the activated form of CaMKII 
(11). However, phosphorylation by CaMKII of Ser1303 on NR2B reduces the affin-
ity of the distal site and leads to slow dissociation of the kinase from NR2B (217). 
The tail of NR2A binds CaMKII with a lower affinity than NR2B. Binding to a site 
in NR2A between residues 1244 and 1464 is enhanced by activation by Ca2+/CaM 
and by autophosphorylation (74). Phosphorylation by protein kinase C of Ser1416 in 
NR2A inhibits binding of CaMKII and promotes dissociation of the CaMKII/NR2A 
complex, providing a mechanism by which activation of mGluRs could decrease 
binding of CaMKII to the NMDA receptor (72). These interactions are likely impor-
tant for appropriate positioning of CaMKII in the spine, although their precise func-
tional roles, in particular, the significance of the difference in binding bwtween 
NR2A and NR2B, have not yet been dissected. 
The NR1 subunit, which contains a 30 residue membrane proximal region termed 
C0 in its short cytosolic tail (121), can bind to CaMKII. Like the binding to the 
membrane proximal domain of the tail of NR2B, binding to NR1 requires autophos-
phorylation of CaMKII at Thr286. Both α-actinin and Ca2+/CaM also bind to the C0 
domain, and binding of CaMKII is competitive with their binding (121). Binding of 
α-actinin has been shown to increase the open probability of the NMDAR. For this 
reason, it has been suggested that the competitive binding of autophosphorylated 
CaMKII may contribute to Ca2+-dependent inactivation of NMDARs (117, 257). 
Translocation of CaMKII into spines following stimulation of glutamate recep-
tors has been observed with the use of GFP-labeled CaMKII transfected into cultured 
neurons. In young, cultured hippocampal neurons, pharmacological stimulation of 
NMDARs caused a rapid, transient redistribution of CaMKII from the actin cy-
toskeleton to synaptic sites (203, 204). In another paradigm, chemical induction of 
LTP in hippocampal slices by application of forskolin in medium containing no Mg2+ 
caused translocation of CaMKII into spines (172). Hypoxia can also cause accumula-
tion of CaMKII in the PSD (53, 218), so there was some doubt about whether"

physiological stimulation in vivo produces translocation of CaMKII to the PSD. 
However, translocation under normal physiological circumstances in vivo was re-
ported in living zebrafish (76) where repeated sensory stimulation produced repro-
ducible and reversible translocation of GFP-CaMKII to the PSD in an identified 
interneuron in the sensorimotor circuit. 
The complex regulation of localization of CaMKII in the spine observed in cells 
and in the PSD, studied biochemically, illustrates how scaffold proteins may help to 
dynamically configure the location of regulatory proteins in the spine. For example, 
binding of Ca2+/CaM to CaMKII causes its release from F-actin (168) and from the 
scaffold protein MUPP1 (116). On the other hand, binding of Ca2+/CaM and auto-
phosphorylation dramatically increase binding of CaMKII to the NMDAR. Thus, 
Ca2+ influx into the spine would be predicted to promote release of CaMKII from the 
spine actin cytoskeleton and subsequent binding to the NMDAR (2, 152). As another 
example, binding of CaMKII to the NMDAR or to densin is facilitated by concomi-
tant binding of these proteins to α-actinin (121, 236). However, densin has a much 
greater affinity for the α-subunit of CaMKII than for the β-subunit (236); whereas, 
the NMDAR does not show this selectivity. The α-subunit, and not the β-subunit, 
can be synthesized from mRNA in dendrites in response to synaptic stimuli that 
induce potentiation (30, 173). Thus, densin in the PSD may preferentially concen-
trate holoenzymes of CaMKII that are newly synthesized in dendrites. 
3.2.2 RasGRF1  
Activation of ras is critical for regulation of insertion and removal of AMPA recep-
tors in the spine (260) and for activation of the protein kinase cascade leading to 
activation of MAP kinases Erk 1 and 2 (219). Ras can be activated at synapses via 
several different receptors, including the Trk receptor protein tyrosine kinases. How-
ever, rasGRF1, a ras-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) that is regulated by 
Ca2+/CaM, provides a means by which activation of the NMDAR can directly acti-
vate ras and its downstream pathways (62, 80, 115). RasGRF1 has been shown to 
bind to the cytosolic tail of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor (115). This 
binding would locate rasGRF1 near the mouth of the NMDAR and thus enable it to 
efficiently sense a local rise in Ca2+ concentration around the activated receptor. 
Learning and memory are impaired in rasGRF1 knockout mice (25, 75), confirming 
the importance of this protein in synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, disruption of the 
interaction between rasGRF1 and the NMDA receptor by introduction of a specific 
peptide blocker into neurons disupts activation of the ERK1/2 pathway following 
application of NMDA (115). 
The finding that rasGRF1 associates specifically with the NR2B subunit of the 
NMDAR, and not with NR2A, suggests that the presence of rasGRF1 might be an 
important difference between signaling complexes formed near receptors containing 
NR2A subunits and those containing only NR2B. There may be competition between 
rasGRF1 and CaMKII for binding to NR2B. The binding sites for the two proteins 
on NR2B overlap extensively; however, it hasn’t yet been demonstrated that they 
compete for binding. SynGAP, a ras inactivating GTPase that binds to PSD-95 is 
stimulated by phosphorylation by CaMKII that is activated by Ca2+ flux through the"

NMDA receptor. The relative timing of activation of rasGRF and synGAP would 
determine the time course of ras activation near NMDARs. It will be interesting to 
learn how interactions among the scaffold proteins associated with the NMDAR in 
the PSD regulate this timing. Since ras can drive insertion of AMPA receptors into 
the synaptic plasma membrane, and also leads to changes in the actin cytoskeleton 
through activation of rac, the answer will have implications for the orchestration of 
activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the spine. 
4 Scaffold Proteins Associated with AMPA-Type Glutamate 
Receptors 
AMPARs mediate rapid excitatory glutamatergic transmission in the brain. They are 
composed of four homologous subunits (GluR1-4, also called GluRA-D) which 
assemble in combinations to form the distinct AMPAR subtypes (50, 86, 147, 148). 
Their trafficking to, insertion into, and removal from the postsynaptic membrane is 
tightly regulated at all stages of development. In mature neurons, this regulation 
underlies activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength such as LTP and LTD (7, 
Five scaffold proteins interact directly with GluR subunits and participate in 
regulation of AMPAR trafficking: Stargazin (a TARP protein), GRIP (GluR-
interacting protein)/ABP (AMPAR-binding protein), PICK1 (protein interacting with 
C kinase 1), and NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor). PSD-95 participates indi-
rectly in trafficking of AMPARs through its interaction with Stargazin. In addition, 
PSD-95 binds directly to the GluR6 and KA2 subunits of kainate receptors (70, 151). 
4.1 GRIP/ABP, PICK1, and NSF 
Certain scaffold proteins bind selectively to the GluR2/3 AMPARs and are believed 
to regulate their insertion into, and removal from, synaptic sites (133). Two of these, 
the homologous proteins GRIP (GRIP1) (51) and ABP (GRIP2) (52, 213, 249) con-
tain a total of six to seven PDZ domains and no catalytic domains. The cytosolic tail 
of GluR2 can bind to the fourth or fifth PDZ domain of either protein. Both GRIP 
and ABP are palmitoylated. The palmitoylated form is targeted to the postsynaptic 
membrane; whereas, the nonpalmitoylated form is targeted to intracellular mem-
branes (48, 253). Thus, regulated palmitoylation of GRIP and ABP is believed to 
anchor AMPARs to one or the other of these membrane compartments to modulate 
AMPAR trafficking (23, 47, 48, 66, 85, 102, 169, 202). However, disruption of the 
9, 16, 26, 43, 82, 92, 128, 140, 141, 145, 175, 207, 208, 210). In pyramidal neurons 
of the hippocampus, where their regulation is most often studied, AMPARs are pri-
marily hetero-oligomers of GluR1 and 2 subunits (GluR1/2) or of GluR 2 and 3 
subunits (GluR2/3). The insertion of GluR1/2 AMPARs into the postsynaptic mem-
brane is regulated by synaptic activity (207); whereas, GluR2/3 AMPARs cycle 
constitutively in and out of the postsynaptic membrane. The detailed mechanisms of 
AMPAR trafficking are discussed in the Chapter by Esteban. Here we focus on in-
teractions of GluR subunits with scaffold proteins that contribute to their localization 
at the postsynaptic membrane."

interaction between the AMPAR and GRIP/ABP interferes more severely with synap-
tic localization of the receptors than with internal trafficking (51). Thus, we still have 
an incomplete understanding of the role of GRIP and ABP in receptor localization. 
A third scaffold protein that binds to GluR2 is PICK1, which contains a PDZ 
domain that binds selectively to protein kinase C-α (PKCα) (214) and a BAR do-
main that binds preferentially to curved membranes (182). PICK1 and GRIP/ABP 
appear to work together to regulate trafficking and surface expression of GluR2/3 
receptors. In addition to PKCα, the single PDZ domain of PICK1 also associates 
with the cytosolic tail of the short forms of GluR2 and GluR3 subunits (49). Through 
formation of homomultimers, PICK1 is believed to position PKCα near the tail of 
GluR2 (39, 181) where it can phosphorylate GluR2 on serine-880 (144, 181). This 
phosphorylation releases GluR2 from GRIP/APB, but leaves it bound to PICK1. 
Dissociation of GluR2 from GRIP/ABP appears to be required for both insertion 
and removal of AMPARs at synaptic sites (23, 47, 66, 85, 102, 169, 202). The pro-
posed mechanism begins with PICK1 promoting dissociation of GluR2 from 
GRIP/ABP when it binds to the GRIP/ABP/GluR2 complex and induces phosphory-
lation of GluR2 on serine-880 by PKC. As GRIP/ABP unbinds from the phosphory-
lated form of GluR2, PDZ domains on PICK1 multimers bind to the freed PDZ-
binding motif on GluR2. The BAR domain on PICK1 then promotes association of 
GluR2 with budding endo- and exocytotic vesicles that mediate trafficking of AM-
PARs to and from the postsynaptic membrane. This mechanism is consistent with the 
findings that PICK1 promotes both internalization and recycling of GluR2 (133), and 
that disruption of interaction of GluR2/3 with PICK1 or GRIP/ABP impairs expres-
sion of LTD (102, 202). 
Although they are not strictly scaffold proteins, NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive 
fusion protein) and the clathrin adaptor AP2 interact with the cytosolic tail of the 
GluR2 subunit at a membrane proximal region different from the C-terminal PDZ-
binding domain that interacts with GRIP/ABP and PICK1. They are required for 
regulation of AMPAR trafficking and surface expression and thus they also have 
been shown to be important for normal expression of synaptic plasticity, in particular 
LTD (120, 136, 163, 170, 211). 
Scaffold proteins generally interact with several proteins, sometimes at the same 
sites. In this regard, PSD scaffold proteins are no exception. In addition to the 
AMPAR, GRIP/ABP binds to the cytosolic tail of the receptor tyrosine kinase 
EphB2 (87), the scaffold protein Liprin-α (247), and the neuronal ras-GEF GRASP-1 
(255). Interactions with these proteins likely help to regulate other, less well under-
stood, aspects of postsynaptic function. 
4.2 SAP97 and SAP102 
The PSD-95 homologues, SAP97 and SAP102, have functions distinct from, but 
related to, those of PSD-95. SAP97 binds specifically to the tail of the GluR1 subunit 
of AMPARs (122, 197). It can form a trimeric complex with GluR1 and the motor 
protein myosin VI (244). The interaction of GluR1 and SAP97 occurs early in the 
biosynthetic pathway of the receptor, either in the endoplasmic reticulum or cis-
Golgi apparatus; on the other hand, few synaptic receptors are associated with"
119,"===== Page 14 =====
420 
M.B. Kennedy et al. 
 
SAP97 (197). These results suggest that SAP97 may mediate trafficking of GluR1 to 
the synapse via a myosin VI motor pathway. SAP102 associates with the tails of 
NMDA receptor subunits, but is most prominently expressed early in development 
(184). In mice, the levels of SAP102 decrease during the second week after birth, 
while levels of PSD-95 increase. Thus, SAP102 may play an important role in trans-
port or targeting of NMDARs in the early stages of synaptic development. 
4.3 Stargazin and PSD-95 
Stargazin is a member of a family of proteins, collectively referred to as TARPs. The 
family comprises Stargazin (also called  γ-2) and three homologous proteins (γ-3, γ-
4, and γ-8), all of which are transmembrane auxiliary subunits of AMPARs (162, 
171, 225). Stargazin/γ-2 is structurally related to the γ-1 subunit of the voltage-
dependent calcium channel (VDCC) and was initially believed to be a calcium chan-
nel subunit (124). It was soon recognized that the TARPs are not part of the VDCC; 
rather they bind to subunits of the AMPA receptor (36, 226) and influence their 
trafficking, targeting, and biophysical properties (67, 159, 233). 
TARPs contain a C-terminal consensus binding motif that binds selectively to the 
first two PDZ domains of PSD-95 (67). This interaction is required for activity-
dependent translocation of AMPA receptors to postsynaptic sites (199). Disruption 
of the synaptic localization of PSD-95 dramatically reduces the number of synaptic 
AMPARs (58). In contrast, when PSD-95 is over-expressed the number of synaptic 
AMPARs increases (199), producing an enhancement of AMPA receptor-mediated 
synaptic transmission that occludes LTP and increases the amplitude of LTD (215). 
These findings suggest that interaction of AMPAR/TARP complexes with PSD-95 
recruits extrasynaptic AMPAR/TARP complexes to postsynaptic sites in order to 
increase synaptic strength (57). The mechanisms of AMPA receptor trafficking and 
its role in synaptic plasticity are discussed in more detail in Chapters by Esteban, 
Choquet and Triller, and Lisman and Hell. 
5 Protein Complexes Associated with the Metabotropic Glutamate 
Receptor Through the Scaffold Protein Homer 
Glutamate activates two groups of G-protein coupled metabotropic receptors that 
modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic strength. Group I mGluRs, mGluR1 and 
mGluR5, regulate phospholipase C which produces the second messengers IP3 and 
diacylglycerol. Group I mGluRs are concentrated at the periphery of the PSD (10, 
135, 165) and can influence synaptic plasticity (22). Their linkage to the PSD is 
mediated by the homer family of scaffold proteins (24, 250). The family comprises 
homer1, 2, and 3, each of which is alternatively spliced into long and short isoforms 
(termed “a” isoforms) (95, 250). All of the homers contain an N-terminal EVH1 
proteins (13). The long homer isoforms contain a C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) do-
main which promotes their self-association into tetramers (81, 220). In contrast, the 
short isoforms do not contain the CC domain and thus are monomeric (95). The short 
domain which binds to a proline-rich motif (PPXXF) in mGluRs and in several other"
120,"===== Page 15 =====

homers, for example homer1a, were originally discovered as “immediate early 
genes” whose expression is rapidly induced by synaptic activity (24). In contrast, 
long homers, for example homer1b/c, are constitutively expressed (61, 251). 
5.1 Linkage to the IP3R and Shank/proSAP 
In addition to group 1 mGluRs, the EVH1 domain of homer binds to the type 1 inosi-
tol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) (229) and shank, a PSD scaffold protein (228). 
Because the long homer isoforms can form tetramers, they act as hubs that cross-link 
the different EVH1 domain-interacting proteins (228, 229). In contrast, the short 
monomeric homers antagonize this function and thus act as endogeneous “dominant 
negatives”, breaking up linkages between mGluRs and other EVH1-interacting  
proteins when they are rapidly and transiently expressed upon synaptic stimulation 
(24, 96). 
An interesting example of this dynamic is the coupling between group 1 mGluRs 
and IP3Rs (229). The IP3R is an IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channel localized in the smooth 
endoplasmic reticulum (SER). Activation of group 1 mGluRs results in production of 
the second messenger IP3. IP3 binds to the nearby IP3R causing it to open and re-
lease Ca2+ from the SER, which functions as an intracellular calcium store. The 
mGluR/homer/IP3R complex thus couples synaptic activation of group 1 mGluRs to 
release of Ca2+ from SER located in dendritic spines (196). In the electron micro-
scope, the SER of dendritic spines can be seen juxtaposed to the postsynaptic mem-
brane at the periphery of the PSD where group I mGluRs and homer are located 
(250). Activity-induced expression of short isoforms of homer apparently interferes 
with the coupling between mGluRs and the IP3R, because over-expression of a short 
homer impairs release of intracellular calcium evoked by quisqualate, an mGluR 
agonist (229). Binding of the short form homer1a to receptor isoforms mGluR1a and 
mGluR5a and b also induces constitutive receptor activation (5). When the long 
homer3 is in excess, it masks the constitutive activity conferred by homer1a (5). 
Thus, expression of homer1a would be expected to reduce release of Ca2+ from intra-
cellular stores following activation of mGluRs; but, for some receptor subtypes, 
increase production of IP3 and diacylglycerol. 
6 The Shank/proSAP Scaffold of Scaffolds 
The distribution of scaffold proteins in the PSD, measured by immunoelectron mi-
croscopy, suggests a laminar organization (183, 232). The peak concentration of 
PSD-95 occurs at an average distance of 12 nm from the synaptic plasma membrane; 
whereas, the peak of GKAP-shank was detected at an average distance of 24–26 nm 
from the membrane. Cript and dynein, which may help to link PSD proteins to cy-
toskeletal elements, lie even further away, 29–31 nm from the membrane. The 
shank/ProSAP family of scaffold proteins (20, 21, 129, 158, 228, 254) acts as a scaf-
fold of scaffolds, linking together PSD-95-associated proteins, homer-associated 
proteins, and the actin cytoskeleton (8, 19, 206)."

6.1 Shank/proSAP Multimerization 
Shank forms homomultimers through interactions of its SAM domains with each 
other and with sharpin (130, 158). Its single PDZ domain can also dimerize in an 
anti-parallel configuration, contributing to multimerization (90). The SAM domains 
form sheets of helical rods in vitro suggesting that shank multimers may form a 
platform that stabilizes the organization of the PSD (8). By virtue of shank’s rich 
collection of protein-interaction domains (6-7 ankyrin repeats, an SH3 domain, a 
PDZ domain, a proline-rich region) this two-dimensional protein lattice could likely 
accommodate several ligands including homer and GKAP/SAPAP, which links to 
PSD-95 (8). The shank platform could thus cross-link the NMDA and metabotropic 
glutamate receptor complexes. It may also link to AMPAR complexes either via 
direct binding to the GluR1 subunit (230) or through interactions between the TARP 
proteins and PSD-95 (162). 
6.2 Interaction with Homer 
The physical interaction between group 1 mGluRs and the shank scaffold is medi-
ated by the long isoforms of homer (56). This structural coupling may underlie func-
tional coupling between group 1 mGluRs and the NMDAR (166), in which mGluR1 
can upregulate current through the NMDAR by stimulating phosphorylation of the 
receptor by the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) and Src-family kinases that are 
part of the NMDAR complex (83). The long isoforms of homer and shank also ap-
pear to cooperate in morphogenesis of dendritic spines. Accumulation of shank in 
synapses depends on its ability to bind to Homer (194) and also to GKAP/SAPAP 
(158). When over-expressed alone or in combination, the long isoforms of homer 
and shank synergistically increase the number and size of spines (195). As expected, 
overexpression of the short isoforms of homer have the opposite effect on spine 
morphogenesis, reducing synaptic targeting of shank and other PSD proteins, and 
inhibiting synaptic transmission (194). 
6.3 Interaction with the Actin Cytoskeleton 
Through its interactions with cortactin, Abp1 and spectrin/fodrin, the shank scaffold 
mediates binding of the PSD to the underlying spine actin cytoskeleton (18, 158, 
186) and thus facilitates a functional connection between activation of postsynaptic 
receptors and changes in the spine cytoskeleton, as discussed below. 
7 Attachment of the Cytoskeleton to the PSD by Actin-Associated 
Proteins 
Dendritic spines contain a higher density of actin filaments than any other neuronal 
structure, and the arrangement of these filaments gives spines their characteristic 
shapes (63, 143). The narrow neck contains longitudinally bundled filaments, 
whereas the head contains a lattice-like mesh that supports its bulbous shape (118)."

Scaffold Proteins in the Postsynaptic Density
423
 
 
 
In mature synapses, the actin cytoskeleton immobilizes some, but not all, compo-
nents of the PSD. For example, treatment of cultured neurons with latrunculin A, a 
toxin that causes depolymerization of actin by sequestering G-actin, results in a de-
crease in spines of AMPA and NMDA receptors, α-actinin-2, drebrin (an actin bind-
ing protein that can cluster actin), and CaMKII. Thus, the attachment of F-actin to 
the PSD contributes to immobilization of receptors and other proteins at the synapse 
and helps to regulate their function. In contrast, PSD-95 remains in spines even after 
the depolymerization of actin (3, 4), suggesting that PSD-95 may form a stable core 
scaffold that does not require the cytoskeleton for its aggregation. 
Three actin binding proteins physically connect the cytoskeleton to the PSD: α-
actinin, cortactin, and spectrin. 
7.1 α-Actinin 
α-Actinin is an actin binding protein that can cross-link actin filaments (153). The α-
actinin family comprises 4 members (α-actinin1-4), of which isoforms 1, 2, and 4 are 
expressed in the brain (235, 236, 246). Proteins of the α-actinin family contain an 
actin-binding domain at the N-terminus, four spectrin repeats in their central region 
(153), and a Ca2+-binding EF hand motif (243) and PDZ domain-binding sequence at 
the C-terminus (236). α-Actinin self-associates into antiparallel dimers that can bind 
actin at both ends, which gives it the ability to crosslink F-actin. Overexpression of 
α-actinin-2 has been shown to increase the length and density of dendritic protru-
sions in cultured hippocampal neurons (160). 
α-actinin also plays an important role in the localization and function of NMDA 
receptors. α-actinin-2 colocalizes with NMDA receptors in spines and binds directly 
to both the NR1 and NR2 subunits (55, 248). This interaction is antagonized by both 
calcium-bound CaM and autophosphorylated CaMKII (121, 248). Interestingly, 
dissociation of the NMDA receptor from F-actin causes rapid inactivation of the 
channel (248, 257), while association with the cytoskeleton enhances NMDA recep-
tor activity (191). Thus, NMDA receptors are probably tethered to F-actin under 
resting conditions but dissociate and become inactivated in response to calcium in-
flux through the channel. 
Another possible point of attachment in the PSD for F-actin via α-actinin is 
densin. The conserved C-terminal region of α-actinin-4 has been shown to bind to 
the PDZ domain of densin. α-actinin-4 can also bind directly to CaMKII; whereas, 
densin binds both α-actinin-4 and CaMKII. Thus, the three proteins form a highly 
stable ternary complex. Autophosphorylation of CaMKII increases its affinity for 
densin, indicating that formation of the complex probably depends on the level of 
intracellular calcium (236). 
7.2 Cortactin 
Cortactin drives de novo nucleation of actin filaments and creates branch points on 
preexisting filaments by activating the ARP2/3 complex. In addition to promoting 
extension of actin filaments, cortactin stabilizes existing F-actin. Cortactin contains"

M.B. Kennedy et al. 
 
an acidic domain at its N-terminus, as do other actin nucleation promoting proteins, 
including WASP, N-WASP, and SCAR/WAVE; all of which interact with the 
ARP2/3 complex (231, 238, 240, 245). The central region of cortactin comprises 6.5 
tandem copies of a 37 amino acid repeat that are the sites of interaction with F-actin 
(245). Its C-terminus contains a helical domain, a proline-rich domain, and an SH3 
domain (46). The SH3 domain of cortactin interacts with a PSD protein originally 
named CortBP1 (54), which is a splice variant of shank2/proSAP-1. This interaction 
has been shown to physically link the PSD scaffold to the cytoskeleton (54, 158). 
Cortactin is highly enriched in spines where it colocalizes with F-actin (84, 188). 
Electron microscopic studies of immunogold labeled cortactin show that approxi-
mately 10% of cortactin in the spine is located in the PSD, while the bulk of the 
staining occurs within the core of the spine, with the peak average concentration 
100–150 nm away from the PSD (188). This finding indicates that there are at least 
two pools of cortactin in the spine, a small one interacting with the PSD, and a larger 
one interacting with the actin cytoskeleton of the spine. Interestingly, NMDA recep-
tor activation induces translocation of cortactin from spines into the dendrite (84), 
suggesting that movement of cortactin might be important for activity-dependent 
remodeling of the spine cytoskeleton. 
As predicted, the level of cortactin is a strong determinant of spine morphology in 
cultured hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of endogenous cortactin in mature cul-
tured hippocampal neurons by siRNA drastically reduces the total number of den-
dritic protrusions (84). This result means that cortactin is required for the mainte-
nance of mature spines perhaps because it stabilizes filaments or promotes overall 
growth of the actin network. Overexpression of cortactin in cultured neurons pro-
duces abnormally long spines, similar to those observed when α-actinin is overex-
pressed. This elongation requires both the N-terminal region of cortactin that inter-
acts with F-actin and the Arp2/3 complex (84). 
7.3 Spectrin/fodrin 
Spectrin is the main component of the cytoskeleton that underlies cell membranes 
and gives them their shape. It was first identified in erythrocytes where it forms a 
filamentous network required for red blood cells to maintain their shape and elastic-
ity (142). The spectrin family of proteins includes α- and β-spectrin and α- and β-
fodrin. Fodrin is the predominant form of spectrin in the brain and is also referred to 
as spectrin II or brain spectrin. The α and β subunits of fodrin differ in their domain 
composition: the α subunit contains 21 triple helical repeats with a segment contain-
ing an SH3 domain in the 10th repeat, while the β subunit contains only 17 triple 
helical repeats and does not contain an SH3 domain. The β subunit also contains an 
actin-binding region at its N-terminus and some splice variants of β subunits contain 
a PH domain. Within the membrane cytoskeleton, the α and β subunits typically 
form heterotetramers by first forming antiparallel heterodimers which then associate 
head to head to form a tetramer. Fodrin connects the actin cytoskeleton to the cell 
membranes by interacting with transmembrane proteins such as ankyrin (44, 77). 
In spines, fodrin is also present in the PSD where it binds directly to NR1, NR2A 
and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors in an activity-dependent manner (33, 125,"
124,"===== Page 19 =====

239). The interaction between fodrin and the NMDAR is regulated by calcium and 
by various protein kinases. Such regulation provides a potential mechanism by which 
the motility of the NMDA receptor in the membrane may be regulated by synaptic 
activity. CaM inhibits binding between fodrin and NR1 and Ca2+ antagonizes binding 
between fodrin and NR2B (239). Binding of fodrin is also inhibited by phosphoryla-
tion of the NR1 C-terminal domain by PKA and PKC and the NR2A C-terminal 
domain by the tyrosine kinase fyn (239). In the neuromuscular junction, removal of 
actin and spectrin from myotube membranes results in dispersal of AChRs (17). By 
analogy, fodrin may be important for immobilizing receptors at the synapse (1). 
8 Conclusion 
The postsynaptic density provides a quintessential example of the organization of 
signaling proteins to provide specificity of regulatory control. Three classes of pro-
teins; the PSD-95 family of MAGUK proteins, the homer family, and the 
shank/proSAP family, have evolved to provide a highly organized structural frame-
work to which signaling molecules can bind to carry out their functions. Future stud-
ies will allow us to understand how this scaffold structure provides for accurate regu-
lation of synaptic plasticity, and how the structure is maintained and sculpted in a 
dynamic equilibrium.

Ca2+ Signaling in Dendritic Spines 
 
Bernardo L. Sabatini1 and Karel Svoboda2 
1 Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School, 220 Longwood Avenue,  
 
 
Abstract. Dendritic spines are neuronal microcompartments that are diffusionally isolated 
from their parent dendrites and neighboring spines. Optical studies of spine Ca2+ dynamics 
have revealed the Ca2+ sources and Ca2+ clearance mechanisms under a variety of 
experimental conditions and in diverse experimental systems. Here we review our 
understanding of Ca2+ signaling in spines, point out gaps in our knowledge, and discuss the 
limits of the existing experimental techniques. 
1 Introduction 
Postsynaptic calcium (Ca2+) signals couple synaptic transmission and neuronal 
excitation to complex intracellular biochemical signals and transduction pathways. 
Of particular interest are Ca2+ accumulations in dendrites and dendritic spines. Spine 
Ca2+ accumulations trigger long-term-potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) of 
synaptic transmission (75). They also trigger structural plasticity of dendritic spines 
(123), activate transcriptional programs (30), and induce cytotoxicity (114). How 
does one second messenger participate in these disparate functions? 
 
The diverse functions of Ca2+ can likely be attributed in part to the diverse 
molecular pathways underlying Ca2+ influx. Depending on the stimulus conditions, 
Ca2+ can enter the spine cytoplasm through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels 
(VSCCs), synaptic glutamate receptors, Ca-induced Ca2+ release and other pathways. 
In addition, Ca2+ signals with different amplitudes and durations likely have different 
meanings for postsynaptic signal transduction. The dynamics of spine Ca2+ signals 
depend on the properties of the Ca2+ sources, on the concentration and affinity of 
endogenous Ca2+ buffers, the efficiency of Ca2+ extrusion, and the local morphology 
of the spine and surrounding dendrite. 
 
The advent of two-photon excitation laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) (16) 
has allowed high-resolution imaging in intact brain slices and even in the intact 
brain. TPLSM together with Ca2+ imaging and two-photon photorelease (TPPR) of

glutamate have allowed the analysis of the factors shaping Ca2+ signals in dendritic 
spines (Fig. 1). We begin by reviewing general and cell-type specific aspects of Ca2+ 
signals in mammalian central nervous system neurons. We then discuss the methods 
used for measuring Ca2+ signals in neuronal microcompartments, with a particular 
emphasis on their limitations.

influx was through NMDARs. (a) A neuron loaded with a high-affinity [Ca2+] indicator (Fluo-
5F; green) and a Ca2+-insensitive fluorophore (Alexa 594; red). (b) Time-lapse image of a 
region of interest (white arrow in (A)). TPPR of glutamate is indicated by the white bar (top,

(c) NMDA-receptor-mediated current measured using a somatic whole cell pipette (black) and 
changes in calcium concentration (boxes in b). Under these conditions ΔG/R = 1 corresponds 
to [Ca2+] = 220 nM. Note that the dendritic Ca2+ accumulations are due to the presence of the 
high-affinity indicator, which slows the extrusion of Ca2+ and facilitates the spread of Ca2+ 
(Equation (1)). Adapted from (100). 
2 General Classes of Postsynaptic Ca2+ Signals 
2.1 Back-Propagating Action Potentials 
In most vertebrate neurons, action potentials are generated near the soma and 
actively propagate down the axon. In many classes of neurons, the action potential 
also invades and propagates through at least the proximal portion of the dendritic 
arbor. These “back-propagating action potentials (bAPs)” open voltage-sensitive"

Ca2+ channels (VSCCs), triggering Ca2+ entry into the dendrite and spines. The 
magnitude and kinetics of bAP-mediated Ca2+ transients as well as the distance that 
the bAP propagates into the dendrite varies among different classes of neurons. 
Furthermore, the classes of VSCCs that are expressed differ between the dendrite 
shaft and spine, between basal and apical dendrites, and between neurons classes. 
 
Nevertheless, bAP-evoked Ca2+ transients share common features across 
neurons. Because the duration of the bAP is typically brief and because VSCC 
activation and deactivation kinetics are fast, bAPs evoke short-lived Ca2+ currents 
(~1 ms). Indeed, the rising phases of bAP-evoked Ca2+ transients in dendrite shafts 
and in spines is so brief that they must result from the opening of voltage-sensitive 
Ca2+ channels (VSCCs) directly in both compartments (e.g. (124)). Pharmacological 
analysis has identified multiple classes of VSCCs in spines with the exact 
complement of channels varying both by cell type and species (8, 12, 21, 40, 89, 95, 
122). The functional relevance of bAP triggered activation of VSCCs is unclear, but, 
as discussed below, opening of VSCCs on the spine head can activate Ca-dependent 
signaling cascades that regulate other ion channels expressed in the spine (8, 122). 
2.2 Synaptically-Evoked Ca2+ Transients 
Glutamatergic synapses typically contain at least one class of ionotropic glutamate 
receptor that is Ca2+ permeable. This can be NMDA-type glutamate receptors 
(NMDARs), which efficiently conduct Ca, or certain isoforms of AMPA (AMPARs) 
and Kainate-type glutamate receptors (KRs) that, depending on their subunit 
composition, can be Ca2+ permeable. In addition, metabotropic-glutamate receptors 
(mGluRs) may also be expressed at synapses. These G-protein coupled receptors 
(GPCRs) typically signal through Gq-type G-proteins and phospholipase C (PLC) to 
trigger the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. 
 
Synaptically-evoked Ca2+ transients are spatially and temporally complex 
compared to those evoked by bAPs (17, 124). Since Ca2+ entry is spatially 
inhomogeneous – i.e. it occurs at active synapses but neither in the remainder of the 
dendrite nor in inactive spines – [Ca] gradients are present along the dendrite. In 
spiny neurons, the thin spine neck (see Chapter by Harris) posses a significant barrier 
to diffusion that restricts synaptically-evoked Ca2+ increases to the head of the active 
spine (59, 87, 104). In aspiny neurons, synaptically-evoked Ca2+ increases are 
restricted to small stretches of dendrites in the immediate vicinity of active synapses 
due to the action of low-mobility Ca-binding proteins, efficient Ca2+ clearance, and 
other specializations of the dendrite (31, 102). 
 
Because of its relevance to the induction of synaptic plasticity, NMDAR-
dependent Ca2+ signaling has been extensively studied (Fig. 1). NMDARs typically 
bind glutamate with high-affinity and therefore stay open for ~100 ms (50), 
generating prolonged Ca2+ increases in the spine head (58, 125). NMDAR opening 
depends not only on glutamate binding but is also regulated by extracellular Mg ions 
that transiently enter and exit the conduction pore and provide a flickering, voltage-
dependent block of the channel (64, 80). For this reason, NMDAR conductance at 
typical resting potentials is reduced ~20 fold compared that in the absence of 
extracellular Mg. However, because the block by Mg is incomplete and the driving"

force for Ca2+ entry is very large, NMDAR mediated Ca2+ transients in active spines 
reach ~ 1 μM even in neurons at resting potentials and in the presence of normal 
extracellular Mg (90). Furthermore, the voltage-dependence of Mg block makes Ca2+ 
influx through NMDARs dependent on the local, subthreshold changes in membrane 
potential and sensitive to the activity of AMPARs, voltage-sensitive Na and Ca2+ 
channels, and Ca-activated K channels near or in the postsynaptic terminal (8, 21, 48, 
76, 78). Lastly, if synaptic stimulation is followed shortly by a bAP, Mg block of the 
NMDAR is further relieved and Ca2+ influx through the receptor is accentuated (12, 
46, 57, 76, 77, 124). However, because the bAP is brief and the kinetics of Mg block 
are rapid, this effect is transient and contributes a rapid, pulse-like increase in Ca2+ 
influx through the NMDAR. Conversely, a bAP that arrives shortly before a synaptic 
stimulus can suppress synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals in spines (46, 76), although 
the effect is small. 
 
These nonlinear effects on Ca2+ signals of closely timed synaptic stimuli and 
bAPs may be necessary for “spike-timing dependent plasticity” (STDP) generated by 
pairing protocols (reviewed (14)). This form of plasticity has been demonstrated in a 
variety of neurons including hippocampal (7, 15), layer 5 and 2/3 (25, 29, 61) 
 
Ca-permeable AMPARs may also contribute to synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals 
in a variety of non-pyramidal cell types (12, 102, 116). AMPARs lacking the GluR2 
subunit have high Ca2+ permeability compared to receptors that contain this subunit 
(37, 39, 42, 96). Ca-permeable AMPARs are not found in all neurons and are even 
differentially expressed in synapses of individual neurons (81, 110). Furthermore, 
even in neurons that express GluR2, highly Ca-permeable GluR2-lacking AMPARs 
may still form and endow spines with AMPAR-mediated synaptic Ca2+ signals. For 
2.3 General Mechanisms of Ca2+ Clearance and Sequestration 
The resting level of free Ca2+ in neurons is on the order of 100 nM and is set by the 
balance of Ca2+ influx and efflux. When Ca2+ is increased beyond the resting level 
net extrusion of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm occurs through one of several mechanisms. 
ATP-utilizing transporters pump Ca2+ across the plasmamembrane and out of the cell 
(plasmamembrane Ca2+ ATPase, PMCA) or across the ER membrane and into its 
lumen (smooth endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, SERCA). In addition, the 
Ca/Na exchanger uses net influx of Na to power the extrusion of Ca2+ and may 
contribute not only to the clearance of Ca2+ but to the accumulation of Na following 
strong activity (84). Once Ca2+ enters the cytoplasm, most of it is rapidly bound by 
Ca2+ binding proteins. The concentrations and affinities of Ca2+ binding proteins vary 
 
pyramidal neurons as well as in striatal medium spiny (28), cortical layer 4 (20), and 
dorsal cochlear nucleus neurons (113). In general, LTP is triggered if the synaptic 
activity consistently precedes bAPs by <10 ms, whereas LTD occurs if the bAP 
precedes the synaptic activity by less than ~100 ms (25, 55, 57, 61, 118, 119, 126) 
(however see (20, 113) for exceptions). 
example, in striatal medium spiny neurons, which express GluR2, a subpopulation of 
Ca-permeable AMPARs contribute a small fraction of the total synaptic current but 
mediate a large fraction of synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals (12)."

from neuron to neuron and even within different regions of the cell. For example, in 
apical dendritic spines of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons ~25 ions of Ca2+ are 
bound by protein for every one that remains free whereas in the cell body and apical 
dendrite the ratio is closer to 100:1 (60, 90). As explained in the Perturbations due to 
Ca2+ indicators section below, the ratio of bound to free Ca2+ is referred to as the 
“Ca2+ binding ratio” and affects the amplitude and time course of intracellular Ca2+ 
transients as well as the diffusion of Ca2+ within the cytoplasm. 
3 Cell-Type Specific Features of Ca2+ Signaling 
3.1 Pyramidal Neurons 
In pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and cortex, activation of the synapse 
associated with an individual dendritic spine leads to Ca2+ accumulation that is 
limited to the spine head (48, 58, 70, 79, 87, 100, 124, 125). These synaptically-
evoked Ca2+ signals are principally mediated by NMDARs and are largely 
eliminated by pharmacological antagonists of these receptors (48, 58, 87, 125). 
Synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals have been most extensively examined in spines of 
CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons and results from studies of these cells will be 
used for the discussion in this section. In these cells, the amplitude and kinetics of 
synaptically-evoked spine head Ca2+ signals are determined by the properties and 
numbers of NMDARs present in the postsynaptic terminal as well as by the 
membrane potential, the activity of kinases and phosphatases, and the opening of 
other ion channels in the active spine. 
 
NMDARs are heteromers of NR1 and NR2 subunits, and the subunit 
composition of the receptor strongly influences synaptic Ca2+ signals. In rat CA1 
pyramidal neurons, NMDARs containing NR1 and NR2A or NR2B subunits are 
typically found in spines and at synapses. The contributions of NR2A and NR2B 
containing receptors to NMDAR-dependent currents and spine head Ca2+ transients 
vary widely from spine to spine (100). Since NR2B-containing NMDARs deactivate 
more slowly (67), contribute relatively more Ca2+ to synaptically-evoked Ca2+ 
transients (100), and are coupled to different downstream signaling systems than 
NR2A-containing receptors (3, 101), this heterogeneity may allow NMDAR opening 
to have different functional implications for plasticity induction (4, 52, 62) (but see 
(5, 69)). Once incorporated into the synapse, the Ca2+ permeability of NMDARs is 
also regulated on a fast timescale by phosphorylation. For example, PKA activity 
enhances the Ca2+ permeability of both NR2A and NR2B containing receptors (99) 
and repetitive activation of NR2B-containing NMDARs activates a serine/threonine 
phosphatase that acts within an inhibitory regulatory loop to decreases Ca2+ 
permeability of NMDARs (101). 
 
Synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons cells 
are also shaped by the activity and properties of ion channels other than NMDARs. 
Several studies have shown that blocking AMPARs reduces synaptically-evoked 
Ca2+ signals in active spines (23, 48) (although see (58)). Since Ca-permeable 
AMPARs are typically not found at synapses made onto pyramidal neurons"

B.L. Sabatini and K. Svoboda 
 
(although see (83, 109)), these effects suggest that the spine is sufficiently 
depolarized during the synaptic potential to reduce the efficacy of Mg-block of the 
NMDAR, thereby enhancing Ca2+ entry. 
 
Depolarization in the spine head also activates VSCCs that contribute directly to 
spine head Ca2+ transients and indirectly shape synaptic signals. In mouse 
hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons blockade of L-type VSCCs reduces spine head 
Ca2+ transients evoked by 2-photon glutamate uncaging, suggesting that these 
channels contribute to synaptically-evoked Ca2+ transients (8). In these same cells, 
R-type VSCCs are found selectively on the spine and not in the dendrite and their 
blockade leads to a counter-intuitive increase in the amplitude of spine head Ca2+ 
transients and somatic synaptic potentials. This phenomenon is explained by the 
presence of an inhibitory regulatory mechanism in which Ca2+ influx through R-type 
VSCCs activates SK-type Ca-activated K channels which repolarize the spine and 
truncate Ca2+ influx through NMDARs (8, 78). Interestingly, the properties of R and 
L-type VSCCs in the spine head can be quickly modulated and may offer points of 
regulation of synaptic signals. In rat CA1 pyramidal neurons L-type VSCCs opening 
is revealed by activation of noradrenergic receptors (38) whereas activation of L-type 
VSCCs during prolonged bAP trains reduces the opening probability of R-type 
VSCCs (122). 
 
However, conclusions drawn from the analysis of one class of pyramidal neuron 
in one species should not be considered to be generally applicable. Thus, although 
spines of mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons express L-type VSCCs whose 
 
influx through these channels is not detectable in spines of rat CA1 pyramidal 
neurons in the basal state (38, 89). Similarly, contributions of N and P/Q-type 
VSCCs to spine Ca2+ signals are seen in rat cortical layer 5 and mouse CA1 
hippocampal pyramidal neurons but not in rat CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons 
(8, 89, 95, 122). Furthermore, the contribution of Ca2+ release from intracellular 
stores to synaptic signals in pyramidal neurons in controversial. Endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) is a prominent internal Ca2+ store found in many spines in 
hippocampal pyramidal neurons (2, 103), with ryanodine receptors (RyRs) found in 
both dendrites and spines, and IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) restricted to dendrites (6, 97). A 
subset of studies have found that NMDAR activation triggers Ca2+ release from 
internal Ca2+ stores (1, 23), possibly via Ca-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). However, 
this contribution may depend on the recording conditions or experimental 
preparation, having been described in organotypic slices (23) but not in acute slices 
(48, 58, 87). Other studies have found that combinations of strong synaptic 
stimulation, bAPs trains, and GPCR activation can trigger waves of Ca2+ release 
from intracellular stores in the apical dendrite (72, 73). 
3.2 Purkinje Cells 
Cerebellar Purkinje Cells (PCs) have large dendrites with a very high density of 
spines and receive >100,000 glutamatergic synapses from parallel fibers (PFs), the 
axons of granule cells (98). In addition, mature PCs receive a powerful input from a 
single climbing fiber, the terminal axon of a neuron in the inferior olive. 
opening contributes to both bAP- and synaptically-evoked Ca2+ transients (8), Ca2+"

Synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals in PCs dendrites have been extensively studied and 
found to be fundamentally different than those in pyramidal neurons. Mature PCs 
lack functional NMDARs (24, 82), and PF-evoked Ca2+ signals are instead mediated 
by activation of synaptic AMPARs and mGluRs. Furthermore, PF-evoked Ca2+ 
signals in PC dendrites vary dramatically in amplitude and spatial extent depending 
on the strength of stimulation (35, 65). Weak synaptic stimulation triggers fast Ca2+ 
signals that are localized to individual spines and are mediated either by direct Ca2+ 
influx through AMPARs or by activation of VSCCs in the spine triggered by the 
synaptic potential (17). Stronger stimulation, such as brief trains of subthreshold PF 
input, produces biphasic Ca2+ transients in individual spines or small stretches of 
dendrites and the additional slow component is blocked by mGluR or IP3R 
antagonists (27, 107). Similar, prolonged dendritic Ca2+ transients can be evoked by 
direct activation of mGluRs or intracellular generation of IP3 and are mediated by 
Ca2+ release from internal stores (44, 53). Purkinje cells have ER in dendrites and 
spines and express IP3Rs and RyRs in dendrites as well as IP3Rs in spines (6, 34, 93, 
115). Brief trains of PF activity also induce, in a Ca-dependent manner, production 
of endocannabinoids in the PC dendrite which signal retrogradely to reduce 
probability of glutamate release from the presynaptic bouton (10, 11). Lastly, strong 
parallel fiber stimulation triggers dendritic spikes and large Ca2+ signals that are 
mediated by VSCCs and extend through larger portions of the dendrite (22). 
 
In contrast to the graded nature of PF responses, activation of the CF input 
elicits a complex spike in the PC and a widespread Ca2+ signal in the proximal 
dendrites (85). CF-evoked Ca2+ signals are blocked by AMPAR antagonists, and are 
mediated by VSCCs (45, 47, 65). CF stimulation, when paired with stimulation of PF 
stimulation, nonlinearly boosts synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals in the regions of 
dendrite containing active PF inputs (10, 117). Although CF stimulation alone is 
insufficient to trigger endocannibinoid release, this pairing protocol elevates 
intracellular Ca2+ to levels that trigger production and release of endocannabinoids 
from the PC (9, 10). The mechanism by which pairing CF inputs with weak PF 
stimulation generates supralinear Ca2+ signals is unclear and may include saturation 
of Ca2+ binding proteins in the dendrite (56). A contribution of release of Ca2+ 
release from internal stores has been reported in a study that focused on signaling 
within spines (27, 117) whereas other studies have reported no contribution of Ca2+ 
release (10). 
 
Repetitive, paired activation of CF and PF induces long-term depression (LTD) 
of active PF to PC synapses (41, 51). LTD induction requires Ca2+ signaling, is 
abolished by blocking mGluRs, depleting internal Ca2+ stores, or interfering with 
endocannabinoid mediated signaling (27, 43, 91, 92, 117). 
3.3 Other Spiny Neurons 
Synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals in several other cell types have also been 
examined, including layer 4 spiny stellate cells (76), striatal medium spiny neurons 
(12), olfactory bulb granule cells (21) and lateral amygdala projection neurons (40). 
In the somatosensory cortex, the spines of layer 4 spiny stellate cells display 
synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals mediated by NMDARs (76). While blocking"

AMPARs in these cells also reduces the synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals, this is 
thought to be due to the elimination of relief of Mg block of the NMDARs. In 
contrast, medium spiny neurons in the striatum have synaptically-evoked Ca2+ 
signals in spines that are mediated by both Ca-permeable AMPARs and NMDARs 
(12). In these cells, both AMPAR and NMDAR Ca2+ signals are strongly influenced 
subthreshold shifts in the resting membrane potential. These depolarizations decrease 
the AMPAR Ca2+ signal due a decreased driving force for Ca2+ entry, and increase 
the NMDAR Ca2+ signal via relief of Mg block. Finally, granule cells in the olfactory 
bulb have synaptically-evoked Ca2+ signals at dendrodendritic synapses mediated by 
a variety of Ca2+ sources, including NMDARs, T-type channels and release from 
internal Ca2+ stores (21) 
4 Measuring Spine Ca2+ Signals 
Ca2+ imaging has revolutionized our understanding of Ca2+ signaling in neurons. Ca2+ 
imaging in spines has been made possible by the development of fluorescent Ca2+ 
indicators (reviewed in (112)) and microscopy methods that allow high-resolution 
and high-sensitivity imaging (reviewed in (19)). Cooled CCD cameras and confocal 
microscopy for the first time allowed the imaging of Ca2+ changes in single dendritic 
spines in cultured neurons (71). However, synapses ultimately need to be studied in 
intact tissues, such as brain slices or whole animals. Scattering by neural tissue 
severely degrades contrast and resolution in wide-field and confocal microscopy. 
The problems posed by scattering can be overcome by two-photon excitation laser 
scanning microscopy (TPLSM) (16) (reviewed in (105)). TPLSM can resolve 
individual spines in brain slices (19) and even in the intact brain (18, 49). TPLSM 
can be combined with fluorescent Ca2+ indicators to image Ca2+ dynamics in 
neuronal microcompartments, including spines (124) and presynaptic terminals (13) 
in intact tissues. 
 
Ca2+ imaging has been used to measure the time-course of Ca2+ signals in 
response to physiological stimuli. However, since Ca2+ indicators are Ca2+ buffers, 
 
indicators are non-linear Ca2+ sensors with limited dynamic ranges. A critical 
assessment of results derived with Ca2+ imaging in dendritic spines must take the 
limitations of Ca2+ imaging into account. 
4.1 Resolution Limits 
TPLSM can resolve objects ~0.5 micrometers apart, sufficient to isolate fluorescence 
signals arising from most spines without crosstalk with other spines and the parent 
dendrite (105). For example, Ca2+ signals in “mushroom” and “thin” spines can be 
isolated (definitions of spine types are from (33)). However, the length of “stubby 
spines”, which lack spine necks, is on the order of the resolution limit of TPLSM, 
making them impossible to resolve from their parent dendrite. In addition, the lack of 
a spine neck makes the delineation of spine head and dendrite arbitrary. For stubby 
spines, fluorescence signals from spine and dendrite will thus be mixed. 
their presence
distorts the Ca2+ signals (36, 60, 74, 88). Furthermore, Ca2+ 
–"

TPLSM averages signals over the two-photon excitation volume (~0.5×0.5×1.5 
μm3) (105). The excitation volume is on the order of the size of typical spine heads 
(33). Using standard synthetic Ca2+ indicators, TPLSM is therefore insensitive to the 
strong Ca2+ gradients that must exist in dendritic spines. Over the last few years it 
has become clear that Ca2+ gradients, over length scales of nanometers, may be a 
critical determinant of Ca-dependent signaling. In particular, molecular Ca2+ sensors, 
such as calmodulin, are often fixed in Ca2+ microdomains close to a particular Ca2+ 
sources, such as voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs). For example, these 
molecular level interactions determine the VSCC response to intracellular Ca2+ (68). 
The length scales of Ca2+ microdomains (nanometers) are therefore 10–100 times 
4.2 Ca2+ Indicator Calibration 
Standard Ca2+ indicators consist of a fluorophore coupled to a Ca2+ buffer, such as 
ethylenedioxybis(o-phenylenenitrilo) tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). Ca2+ binding 
changes the fluorescence properties of the indicator (typically the fluorescence yield 
increases). A large number of Ca2+ indicators, with differing Kd and dynamic range, 
have become available. The choice of the particular indicator must be made on the 
basis of the amplitude and time-course of the Ca2+ signal to be studied. 
 
For quantitative experiments it is important to operate in the linear range of the 
indicator. Nonlinearities cause difficulties in quantifying [Ca], buffering capacities, 
and biologically interesting fluctuations in [Ca] (89). The fractional nonlinearity 
(NL) is given by ~ [Ca]/Kd. Therefore, when [Ca] <<KD, the fluorescence intensity 
is proportional to [Ca]. Similarly, to limit NL to less than 20%, [Ca] should not 
exceed ~ KD/5. It is best practice to express Ca2+ transient amplitudes in fractional 
units, where “1” corresponds to saturating Ca2+ (8, 94, 101). 
4.3 Perturbations Due to Ca2+ Indicators 
Ca2+ signals in cells are shaped by the Ca2+ sources, Ca2+ buffers, and Ca2+ clearance 
mechanisms (36, 60, 74, 88, 108). Since Ca2+ indicators themselves are Ca2+ buffers 
their presence perturbs Ca2+ signals and downstream signals. Measuring Ca2+ 
therefore invariably perturbs Ca2+ signals and Ca2+ signaling. 
 
A variety of Ca2+ indicators are available to measure Ca2+ over many orders of 
magnitude in concentration. The perturbing effects of Ca2+ buffers can be summarized 
by the buffer binding ratio (κ), the fraction of the total Ca2+ entering the cell that is 
bound to buffers. For buffer X, κx is approximately equal to the concentration of the 
buffer divided by its dissociation constant for Ca2+ (κx = [X]/Kd,x). 
smaller than the resolution limit of optical microscopy. 
 
Action potential-evoked evoked Δ[Ca] can be measured using a variety of 
indicators, but only low affinity indicators (e.g. Fluo-4FF, X-Rhod-FF) are 
appropriate for quantitative measurements of the larger NMDA-mediated [Ca] 
accumulations. Higher Ca2+ indicator concentrations lead to smaller changes in [Ca], 
and therefore also tend to improve linearity, but at the expense of decreasing signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR). Supposedly quantitative Ca2+ imaging studies that do not treat 
indicator non-linearities explicitly should be viewed with skepticism."

The binding ratios for endogenous buffers (κB) are on the order of 100, but can 
range from 20 in small pyramidal dendrites and spines (90) up to more than 1,000 in 
Purkinje neurons (26). The buffer added by the indicator (κi) is typically on the order 
the measured Ca2+ signal. In most experiments the indicator dominates intracellular 
buffers, markedly reducing the amplitudes and prolonging the durations of [Ca] 
transients (86, 90, 121). A variety of schemes have been used to correct for the 
presence of Ca2+ indicators and thereby calculate Ca2+ dynamics in the absence of 
Ca2+ indicators (36, 60, 90). However, these schemes generally are applicable only to 
conditions in which spatial Ca2+ gradients are negligible. This might apply for 
situations in which Ca2+ signals are relatively global and in which Ca2+ dynamics can 
be described by single-compartment models (e.g. action potential-evoked Ca2+ 
dynamics). The vast majority of Ca2+ imaging studies are performed in the regime κI 
>> κB. This means that nearly all Ca2+ ions entering the cell bind to the indicator, and 
changes in fluorescence are proportional to the total amount of Ca2+ entering the cell 
(i.e. the charge). Very few studies have seriously attempted to correct for the 
 
In the presence of Ca2+ gradients, Ca2+ indicators can have highly perturbative 
and non-intuitive effects. In particular, Ca2+ indicators can dramatically accelerate 
the transport of Ca. Transport of Ca2+ is characterized by an effective diffusion 
coefficient, Deff, which depends on the diffusion coefficients of free Ca2+ (DCa), and 
Ca2+ bound to mobile buffers (Dm) and indicator (Di):

4.4 Genetically Encoded Ca2+ Indicators 
Genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) have the potential to overcome some of 
the limitations of synthetic indicators (66). GECIs could be used to reduce the effect 
of Ca2+ indicators on Ca2+ spread. For example, GECIs could be fused to actin, 
which is concentrated in spines and stable over the time scales relevant to Ca2+ 
accumulations. Alternatively, GECIs could be used to selectively read out Ca2+ 
entering neurons through particular channels. For example, low-affinity GECIs could 
of κi ~ 500 (100 µM of Oregon Green Bapta-1 or Fluo-4). The relative magnitudes of 
κi and κB determine the extent to which the presence of the Ca2+ indicator perturbs 
indicator and extrapolate to κI = 0 (e.g. 87). 
κ
endogenous buffers seem to be largely immobile (κm≈0). Equation (1) therefore 
implies that even in situations of “low added buffer” (κi ≤ κB), where [Ca] 
amplitudes and extrusion rates are relatively unperturbed, the spread of Ca2+ can still 
be highly distorted. The presence of indicator rapidly breaks down micrometer-level 
dendritic [Ca] gradients and thus accelerates equilibration of [Ca] between spine and 
dendrite (Fig. 1c). Conclusions about the spread of Ca2+ based on Ca2+ imaging 
therefore need to be viewed with great skepticism. For example, the slight spread of 
Ca2+ observed in Fig. 1b,c can be attributed to the presence of the indicator. 
 
Here κB represents the strength of immobile buffers (DB = 0). The mobilities of 
Ca2+ dyes can be orders of magnitude larger than those of cellular buffers, since"

be fused to particular channels or associated scaffolds (32). Under the appropriate 
conditions (distance between GECI and the mouth of the channel, affinity between 
GECI and Ca2+) GECIs would only respond to Ca2+ entering the cell through the 
tagged channel. However, current GECIs are inferior Ca2+ sensors compared to 
synthetic indicators, producing smaller and slower responses, limiting their use in 
small compartments such as dendritic spines. Furthermore, their responses to Ca2+ 
are complex and non-linear, which may make quantitative Ca2+ measurements 
challenging (121). 
4.5 Two-Photon Glutamate Uncaging 
Analysis of spine Ca2+ signaling has benefited from combining TPLSM and two-
photon photorelease (TPPR) of caged glutamate (63). One laser is used to trigger 
photolysis of caged glutamate while a second is used for Ca2+ imaging (12, 54, 100) 
(Fig. 1). Using this approach, the postsynaptic terminal on a spine can be stimulated 
while the evoked signals are monitored. Furthermore, combined TPLSM and TPPR 
allow analysis of postsynaptic signaling using perturbations that might affect the 
presynaptic terminal. TPPR on single spines can produce postsynaptic currents with 
amplitudes and time-courses that mimic unitary synaptic currents (12, 63). 
 
However, several limitations of this approach must be considered. Glutamate is 
uncaged throughout the two-photon excitation volume and may spread further by 
diffusion before binding to glutamate receptors. The effective volume of TPPR (~1 
fL) is therefore far larger than the synaptic cleft. A different set of receptors, 
including extrasynaptic receptors, may therefore be activated with TPPR compared 
to synaptic transmission. This problem is exacerbated if the duration of the uncaging 
laser pulse is more than a few hundred microseconds. 
 
A related issue is that the efficiency of glutamate receptor activation falls off 
relatively slowly with distance from the spine, with a length constant of ~1 μm (100). 
Dendritic spines need to be chosen for stimulation that are well-separated from other 
spines, biasing the sample. When stimulating short spines, such as stubby spines, 
glutamate receptors on the shaft may also be activated. 
 
Lastly, control of the laser pulse duration and power allows the production of a 
broad range of spatio-temporal glutamate concentration profiles. It is important to 
avoid strong stimuli that might uncover phenomena that have no physiological 
relevance. It is critical to calibrate and standardize the amount of glutamate released 
onto spines at different depths and in varying optical environments (e.g. (8)). 
5 Conclusions and Outlook 
The development of Ca2+ indicators and high-resolution imaging methods have 
revolutionized our understanding of neuronal Ca2+ signaling. In a number of systems, 
and under a variety of physiologically relevant conditions, we understand how Ca2+ 
enters spines. We also understand what fraction of Ca2+ binds to buffers and how 
Ca2+ is eventually cleared from the neuronal cytoplasm. However, we know 
relatively little about the dynamics and roles of the fast nanometer sized Ca2+"

gradients that are known to exit close to the mouth of Ca2+ channels. There is 
mounting indirect evidence that such microdomains are critical to trigger specific 
Ca-dependent signaling in dendritic spines (3, 8, 122). Targeting of Ca2+ sensors to 
particular molecular scaffolds might allow the study of these Ca2+ microdomains (32, 
111) in dendritic spines. In addition, we know little about how Ca2+ activates 
different Ca-dependent pathways. To answer these questions, it will be important to 
develop imaging probes that provide sensitivities similar to Ca2+ indicators to track 
Ca-dependent signaling in neuronal microcompartments (106, 120)."

Postsynaptic Targeting of Protein Kinases  
and Phosphatases 
 
Stefan Strack and Johannes W. Hell 
 
1 Introduction 
The discovery of an unsuspected number of protein-protein interactions during the 
past 15 years was an eye opener for the unanticipated detailed spatial and functional 
organization of proteins inside cells. Colocalization of protein kinases and 
phosphatases with their regulators and substrates is of special interest because it is 
critical for swift, effective, and specific signaling (189). At the plasma membrane a 
number of extracellular signals are relayed with high selectivity to specific 
intracellular signaling pathways. Synapses are rather small subcellular compartments 
that fulfill multiple functions: signal transmission between neurons, processing of 
neuronal signals, and storage of information. Targeting mechanisms for kinases and 
phosphatases are thus particularly important at synapses to ensure spatial and 
temporal fidelity of signal transduction. Such targeting is not limited to kinases but 
often includes upstream regulators and downstream effectors of kinases. For 
instance, PKA forms a signaling complex with the postsynaptic L-type Ca2+ channel 
Cav1.2 that contains all elements of the classic β-adrenergic – PKA signaling 
cascade including the β2 adrenergic receptor, the trimeric G protein Gs, and adenylyl 
cyclase (55, 93). Upon activation of the β2 adrenergic receptor and the ensuing 
cAMP production, PKA phosphorylates Cav1.2 to increase its Ca2+ channel activity. 
Despite involving the diffusible second messenger cAMP, signaling from the β2 
formation of a supramolecular signaling complex (55). 
 
This chapter describes the molecular basis and functional relevance of 
postsynaptic kinase and phosphatase anchoring at glutamatergic synapses. Glutamate 
is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Most synaptic events are 
mediated by AMPA-type glutamate receptors. A temporary increase in transmission 
frequency leads to activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors. The resulting Ca2+ 
influx through NMDA receptors causes long-term-depression (LTD) at more modest 
frequencies (1–3 Hz) and long-term potentiation (LTP) at higher frequencies.

2.1.3 Molecular Mechanisms of Postsynaptic CaMKII Accumulation 
 
  
CaMKII binding proteins that are specifically concentrated at postsynaptic sites are 
the NMDA receptor, densin-180, F-actin, and α-actinin (Table 1). The NMDA 
receptor consists of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits, the latter encoded by four 
genes (NR2A – NR2D) (Chapters by Yuan et al. and Wenthold et al., this volume). 
The prevailing NR2 subunits in mammalian forebrain are NR2A and NR2B. 
CaMKII interacts with NR1 (19, 122, 124, 161), NR2A (81, 83), and NR2B  
(19, 122, 124, 228, 229). The CaMKII binding site on NR1 is formed by residues 
847–861 constituting the C-terminal half of the so-called C0 domain with residues 
849–857 being most critical for the interaction (122) (Leonard and Hell, 
unpublished) (Fig. 1b). CaMKII independently binds to the membrane-proximal 
residues 839–1120 (NR2B/P) and residues 1290–1310 in the 644 amino acid-long 
C-terminus of NR2B (Fig. 1b) (19, 124, 228, 229). The NR2A region that is nearly 
identical to NR2B/C does not bind CaMKII because of the insertion of two vicinal 
residues (Ile-Asp) right in the middle of this motif (15, 83, 229). However, a region 
further downstream has been reported to interact with CaMKII, with residues 1412–
1419 forming the core of this interaction site (80, 82). Phosphorylation of S1303 in 
NR2B/C by CaMKII and of S1415 in NR2A by PKC inhibits CaMKII association 
with these sites (80, 229). 
 
 
Fig. 1. (Continued) (a) Linear model of CaMKII and binding to α-actinin and densin-180. The 
catalytic domain of CaMKII (red) contains the ATP binding site, the substrate binding site  
(S site), and the hydrophobic pocket (T site), which interacts with T286 under resting 
conditions. The T286 segment (brown; T287 in CaMKIIβ) and pseudosubstrate region 
(orange) form the autoinhibitory domain, which binds to the T and S site, respectively, in the 
basal inactive state. 12 subunits interact with their C-terminal association domains (green) to 
form one CaMKII complex. The pseudosubstrate region (orange) overlaps with the Ca2+/CaM 
binding site (yellow). Autophosphorylation of T305 or T306 blocks Ca2+/CaM binding. α-
actinin consists of two calponin-homology domains (CH1, CH2), four spectrin repeats (SR1-
4), two EF hands and a C-terminal region. It binds with its C-terminal region to the catalytic 
domain and possibly the Ca2+/CaM binding site of CaMKII. Densin-180 carries a PDZ 
domain at its N-terminus that interacts with the very C-terminal ESDL sequence of α-actinin. 
The membrane-proximal region of densin-180 is differentially spliced and binds to the 
association domain of CaMKII. It is followed by a transmembrane segment, a glycosylated 
region, and a leucine-rich region (LRR). (b) CaMKII binding sites on NR1 and NR2B/C and 
Phosphorylation Targets stargazin and GluR1. CaMKII binds to the region surrounding 
Ser1303 in the C-terminus of NR2B and to the C0 region in the C-terminus of NR1 (dark 
blue). Critical residues defined by binding studies with peptide libraries of overlapping 
sequences of NR1 C0 and by interaction studies with NR2B/C constructs carrying point 
mutations are given in white on black background. CaMKII can phosporylate S1303 in NR2B, 
S831 in GluR1 (blue) and 9 diferent serines in stargazin (light blue). (c) Interactions of CaM, 
α-actinin, and CaMKII with NR1 C0. Under resting conditions, NR1 C0 simultaneously binds 
to α-actinin and the C-domain of apo-CaM, with α-actinin preventing CaMKII binding. Upon 
addition of Ca2+ as occurring during Ca2+ influx Ca2+/CaM displaces α-actinin, thereby 
promoting CaMKII binding."

CaMKII binding to NR1 and NR2B/P requires T286 autophosphorylation. 
CaMKII binding to NR2B/C can be triggered either by Ca2+/CaM or T286 
autophosphorylation in vitro (19, 122). These biochemical characteristics 
immediately suggest that CaMKII binding to the NMDA receptor depends on Ca2+ 
influx to allow Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKII and T286 autophosphorylation of 
CaMKII (Section 2.1.4). The Kd values for CaMKII binding to NR1 and NR2B are 
in the high nM to low μM range (124, 225, 228), well below the average 
concentration of CaMKII in neurons. Binding to NR2A is much weaker than to NR1 
and NR2B and often hard to detect (124, 228, 229). 
 
The C-terminal half of the NR1 C0 region interacts not only with CaMKII but 
also with CaM and α-actinin (122). The CaMKII binding site partially overlaps with 
the CaM/α-actinin binding site, the latter being C-terminally shifted by 3–4 residues 
(122). Ca2+ free (apo) CaM and α-actinin concurrently bind to NR1 C0 under basal 
conditions (2, 161). Addition of Ca2+ leads to displacement of α-actinin by 
Ca2+/CaM from NR1 C0 (161, 266), which causes inactivation of the NMDA 
receptor (118, 277), likely to limit excessive Ca2+ influx. It is currently unknown 
what role CaMKII binding to NR1 C0 plays. In vitro, NR1 C0 can simultaneously

bind Ca2+/CaM and CaMKII but not α-actinin and CaMKII. We propose that under 
basal conditions with low intracellular Ca2+, apo-CaM and α-actinin interact with 
NR1 C0. Ca2+ influx induces dislocation of α-actinin by Ca2+/CaM, which then 
permits binding of activated CaMKII to this site (Fig. 1c). 
 
Densin-180 selectively binds to CaMKIIα but not CaMKIIβ. Forebrain CaMKII 
holoenzymes, which contain on average 9α and 3β subunits, show little if any 
binding to densin-180 (198, 255). Homomeric CaMKIIα holoenzymes could arise 
from local translation of CaMKIIα mRNA, which is present throughout dendrites in 
contrast to CaMKIIβ mRNA (36). Association of CaMKIIα with densin-180 is 
stimulated by T286 autophosphorylation but does not strictly dependent on it (Kd is 
75–250 nM for T286-autophosphorylated CaMKII and likely more than 10 fold 
higher for unphosphorylated CaMKII) (197, 230, 255). The association domain of 
CaMKIIα binds to residues 1331–1404 immediately upstream of the PDZ domain 
that is located at the C-terminal end of densin-180 (198, 230, 255) (Fig. 1a). 
 
α-actinin is an F-actin binding protein concentrated at various cell adhesion 
sites including dendritic spines (182, 190, 254, 255, 266). The α-actinin family 
comprises 4 genes encoding the highly homologous α-actinin-1 through -4. In 
forebrain neurons mRNA and protein are detectable for α-actinin-1, -2, and -4 but 
not -3 (Schnizler, Hall, and Hell, unpublished results) (190, 254, 255, 266). α-
actinins consist of two calponin homology domains, followed by four spectrin 
repeats, two EF hand motifs, and a C-terminal tail (Fig. 1a). A fragment of CaMKII 
that includes the catalytic and autoinhibitory domain binds to the C-terminal 74–76 
residues of α-actinin-2 and -4 immediately downstream of the two EF hand motifs 
(198, 255) (Fig. 1a). This CaMKII binding site on α-actinin is likely composed of 
non-contiguous segments (198). Whether the extreme C-terminus of α-actinin is 
required for CaMKII binding is a matter of debate (198, 255). This segment and 
especially the last four residues of α-actinin constitute a classical PDZ interaction 
motif (ESDL-COO–; moieties critical for PDZ binding are in bold). This motif binds 
to the PDZ domain at the C-terminal end of densin-180 (198, 255). Densin-180 can 
thus provide an additional link that acts in a synergistic manner to promote CaMKII 
– α-actinin binding (198). 
 
T286 autophosphorylation does not modulate CaMKII binding to α-actinin. 
However, autophosphorylation of T305 and T306 in the Ca2+/CaM binding site of 
the autoinhibitory domain of CaMKII abrogates CaMKII binding for α-actinin (197) 
as it does for Ca2+/CaM (47, 187). T305/306 phosphorylation can occur upon 
Ca2+/CaM dissociation from T286 autophosphorylation CaMKII (161) or association 
with Camguk/CASK (138) (see below). Furthermore, Ca2+/CaM binding to this 
autoinhibitory CaMKII segment and Ca2+/CaM-dependent CaMKII activity is 
competitively blocked by α-actinin indicating that α-actinin and Ca2+/CaM compete 
for the same binding site on CaMKII (EC50 for α-actinin is ~1 μM) (197). Because 
the affinity of Ca2+/CaM for T286-phosphorylated CaMKII is more than 1000 fold 
higher than for unphosphorylated CaMKII (162), Ca2+/CaM competes most 
effectively with α-actinin for T286-phosphorylated CaMKII and much less so for 
unphosphorylated CaMKII (197)."

NR2B/C and α-actinin do not compete with each other or with densin-180 for 
CaMKII binding. Furthermore, monomeric CaMKII lacking the association domain, 
which mediates oligomerization of CaMKII and association with densin-180, is 
capable of simultaneously binding NR2B/C and α-actinin-2. By forming 
dodecameric holoenzyme CaMKII can simultaneously bind multiple NR2B/C, 
densin-180 or α-actinin-2 polypeptides; it can concomitantly interact with NR2B/C 
plus densin-180 or α-actinin and with densin-180 plus α-actinin (198, 255). CaMKII 
could thus play a structural role at the postsynaptic site by forming multimeric 
complexes with NR2B/C, α-actinin, and densin-180 (198, 255). A non-catalytic role 
for CaMKIIα was recently demonstrated in presynaptic events underlying short-term 
potentiation (99) and for CaMKIIβ in bundling F-actin in spines (177). 
 
CaMKIIβ binds with its variable region located between the autoinhibitory and 
association domain to F-actin, which is concentrated in dendritic spines (78, 214). 
This segment is not conserved in CaMKIIα, which thus does not directly interact 
with F-actin but can be recruited to cortical F-actin through CaMKIIβ if co-
assembled into holomers. The F-actin binding segment of CaMKIIβ is located 
immediately downstream of the Ca2+/CaM binding site in the CaMKII autoinhibitory 
domain. Ca2+/CaM binding and T287 autophosphorylation leads to displacement of 
CaMKIIβ from F-actin (212, 214). As this interaction is very dynamic (212, 214) 
and inhibited by CaMKII activation, it cannot mediate activity-induced postsynaptic 
CaMKII accumulation. Nevertheless, it recruits CaMKIIβ to F-actin in spine shafts 
(176, 212), which could function to provide a readily available CaMKII pool for 
swift translocation to the PSD. Furthermore, recent work indicates that CaMKIIβ is 
important for maintaining dendritic spine structure by bundling F-actin with its F-
actin binding domain in conjunction with the CaMKII association domain but 
independent of the kinase domain (177). It seems F-actin and CaMKIIβ mutually 
support each others accumulation in spines. However, the strong rise in postsynaptic 
CaMKII signal following Ca2+ influx can only be explained by translocation of 
extrasynaptic CaMKII to spines (183, 212, 213) (see below and Fig. 2). 
 
Another postsynaptic binding partner for CaMKII is Camguk (138). It is the 
Drosophila homolog of CASK, which consists of an N-terminal CaMKII-like 
domain, followed by SH3, GK, and PDZ domains. The interaction of CaMKII with 
Camguk is enhanced by ATP if Ca2+/CaM is present and by non-hydrolizable ATP 
analogues (138). Perhaps binding of ATP to CaMKII promotes initial Camguk 
binding by fostering exposure of a Camguk binding site on CaMKII. With Ca2+/CaM 
present, autophosphorylation of T287 in Drosophila CaMKII occurs in this complex. 
In the absence of Ca2+/CaM, Camguk-associated CaMKII autophosphorylates on 
T306/307 without T287 autophosphorylation, which is normally required for 
T306/307 phosphorylation (T287/T306/T307 in Drosophila CaMKII are equivalent 
to T286/T305/T306 in mammalian CaMKIIα). T306/307 phosphorylation displaces 
CaMKII from Camguk. T306/307 phosphorylated CaMKII cannot bind Ca2+/CaM. 
At quiescent synapses with little Ca2+/CaM present, Camguk can thus induce 
silencing of CaMKII (138). At active synapses Ca2+/CaM can bind to T306/307, 
thereby inhibiting T306/307 phosphorylation and stabilizing the CaMKII-Camguk 
complex. CASK might perform a similar function in mammals but no evidence is 
available."

2.1.4 Activity-Dependent Postsynaptic Accumulation of CaMKII 
Inhibition of K+ channels with tetraethylammonium (TEA) causes depolarization, 
glutamate release, postsynaptic Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors and Ca2+ 
channels, and synaptic potentiation in hippocampal slices. This chemically induced 
form of LTP increases the amount of CaMKII in a subcellular fraction that is 
enriched in postsynaptic densities (PSD) (227). Specific activation of Ca2+ influx 
through the NMDA receptor by NMDA in the presence of the Na+ channel blocker 
tetrodotoxin (97) augments CaMKII binding to the NMDA receptor NR1 and NR2B 
subunit (124). NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx stimulates postsynaptic 
accumulation of ectopically expressed GFP-CaMKIIα as observed by live imaging 
in hippocampal cultures (183, 212, 213) and in zebrafish in vivo (87). GFP-tagged 
CaMKIIα and β have a pronounced tendency to cluster in neuronal somata and 
dendritic shafts under basal conditions (Chen and Hell, unpublished data). We tested 
whether endogenous CaMKII undergoes activity-driven postsynaptic targeting. 
CaMKII is detectable in synapses under resting conditions likely due to basal 
NMDA receptor activity as postsynaptic CaMKII clustering is reduced by the 
NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 (Fig. 2). Short (60–90 s) application of glutamate 
augments synaptic accumulation of endogenous CaMKIIα and CaMKIIβ in 
dendritic spines as obvious from the enhanced CaMKII staining intensity at synapses 
compared to the intensity in the dendritic shaft (Fig. 2). Glutamate-induced CaMKII 
accumulations colocalize with the presynaptic marker synapsin (Fig. 2) and with 
AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and PSD-95 (Chen and Hell, unpublished). 
CaMKII clustering is blocked by removal of extracellular Ca2+ and by the NMDA 
receptor antagonist MK-801 (Chen and Hell, unpublished). An increase in 
endogenous CaMKIIα  immunoreactivity at the PSD is also detectable by 
immunogold electron microscopy upon glutamate treatment of hippocampal cultures 
for 90 s (69). 
 
Optimal CaMKII binding to the NMDA receptor and densin-180 requires Ca2+ 
for Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKII and ensuing T286 autophosphorylation and for 
displacement of α-actinin from NR1C0 (Section 2.1.3). Therefore, the NMDA 
receptor and densin-180 are the prime candidates for mediating activity-driven 
postsynaptic CaMKII accumulation. These interactions strategically target CaMKII 
to postsynaptic sites that experience increased activation of NMDA receptors as 
occurring during LTP and other forms of synaptic plasticity. CaMKII thus 
accumulates at postsynaptic sites where Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor is 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2. (Continued) Postsynaptic accumulation of endogenous CaMKIIα and β upon stimu-
lation with glutamate. Primary hippocampal cultures (18 DIV) were incubated with vehicle 
(a–c, j–l), 0.1 mM glutamate for 60 s (d–f) or 90 s (g–i, m–o) to induce NMDA receptor-
mediated Ca2+ influx, or 0.1 mM APV for 3 h to block basal Ca2+ influx through NMDA 
receptor (p–r). Cultures were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde, 15 min), permeabilized (0.3% 
Triton X-100), and double stained for CaMKIIα or β plus the presynaptic marker synapsin as 
indicated (131). Glutamate treatment increased synaptic CaMKII staining within 90 s. 
Prolonged APV treatment reduced synaptic CaMKII staining suggesting that postsynaptic 
targeting of CaMKII under basal conditions is at least in part due to spontaneous neuronal 
activity and the ensuing NMDA receptor activation."

highest for further activation of CaMKII and for phosphorylation of nearby AMPA 
receptors and of other proteins critical for LTP. LTP specifically occurs at those 
synapses that receive increased stimulation. Ca2+-induced binding supports CaMKII 
accumulation specifically at those synapses that undergo LTP. Such activity-driven 
accumulation is not only economical but likely also constitutes positive feedback 
that ensures reliable and specific potentiation of stimulated synapses. 
 
Postsynaptic CaMKII accumulation might foster phosphorylation of the AMPA 
receptor GluR1 subunit at S831 (Fig. 1b), which is elevated during LTP (16, 121). 
This phosphorylation increases ion currents through homomeric GluR1 but not 
heteromeric GluR1/R2 receptors (61, 174). However, this phosphorylation likely 
contributes only to a limited degree to LTP and only in mice that are 2 and perhaps 
more than 7 weeks but not 3–4 weeks old. The reason for this limitation is that only 
at the former ages are GluR2-lacking, presumably GluR1 homomeric, AMPA 
receptors functionally present and only transiently so during the first 20 min of LTP 
(1, 142, 193) (Chapter by Lisman and Hell, this volume). This constraint was met in 
previous work showing an increase in AMPA receptor single channel conductivity 
following LTP induction (25). It reduces the time window during which this 
regulation could contribute to potentiation and thereby establishment of LTP during 
its early phase. 
 
CaMKII also contributes to postsynaptic accumulation of GluR1-containing 
AMPA receptors (95, 201). CaMKII phosphorylation of stargazin (see Fig. 1b) (and 
potentially of its relatives γ3, γ4, γ7, γ8) recently emerged as an important molecular 
mechanism in LTP by fostering postsynaptic accumulation of AMPA receptors 
(244). Stargazin also positively modulates gating of AMPA receptors (194, 243, 
250) but it is unclear whether CaMKII regulates gating by phosphorylating 
stargazin. 
2.1.5 Regulation of Postsynaptic Accumulation by CaMKII Autophosphorylation 
Upon Ca2+ influx T286A mutant CaMKIIα translocates like wild-type CaMKIIα to 
postsynaptic sites. However, in contrast to wild-type CaMKII, the T286A mutant 
disperses within a few seconds rather than minutes following cessation of Ca2+ 
influx (212, 213). Furthermore, Ca2+ influx also induces postsynaptic accumulation 
of the phosphomimetic T286D mutant, which requires more than 1 h for relocation 
after termination of Ca2+ influx (213). Accordingly, T286 phosphorylation is not 
sufficient for activity-induced translocation but does stabilize CaMKII at 
postsynaptic sites. The resulting prolonged postsynaptic CaMKII accumulation can 
be reversed by phosphorylation of T305/306 and dephosphorylation of T286: 
mutating T305 and T306 to alanine or application of the phosphatase inhibitor 
calyculin A, like the T286D mutation, slow postsynaptic CaMKII dispersal in 
cultured neurons (212) whereas mutating T305 to aspartate reduces the CaMKII 
content of PSDs in knock-in mice under basal conditions (73). If PKA is stimulated 
in parallel with Ca2+ influx postsynaptically clustered CaMKII is retained for 
extended time periods (183, 213). PKA phosphorylates inhibitor-1, which then 
inhibits the phosphatase PP1 and thereby dephosphorylation of CaMKII on T286 to 
promote LTP (28). PKA could also be involved in prolonged postsynaptic CaMKII 
accumulation upon extended stimulation with glutamate (20), as the ensuing Ca2+ 
influx can activate Ca2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclase 1 and 8."

As T286 autophosphorylation is not sufficient for postsynaptic CaMKII 
accumulation, initial binding might be triggered by Ca2+/CaM, which can induce 
CaMKII binding to NR2B/C in the absence of ATP in vitro (19, 122). In support of 
an important role for binding of Ca2+/CaM to CaMKII in postsynaptic targeting, 
blocking Ca2+/CaM binding by mutating CaMKII A302 to arginine prevents 
glutamate-induced translocation of CaMKIIα (212). A second potential mechanism 
involves displacement of α-actinin from NR1 C0 (Fig. 1c): binding to this site 
requires both T286 phosphorylation and dislocation of α-actinin by Ca2+/CaM (161). 
Accordingly, CaMKII T286D will not be able to bind to NR1 C0 under basal 
conditions as long as α-actinin is associated with NR1 C0. Such a mechanism would 
also explain the finding that translocation of CaMKII to postsynaptic sites requires 
specifically Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors (241). 
2.1.6 Binding-Induced CaMKII Activity 
Once formed, Ca2+/CaM-triggered CaMKII binding to NR2B/C is stable even after 
Ca2+ chelation to remove CaM (19). Notably, a complex between non-
phosphorylated CaMKII and NR2B possesses autonomous activity similar to T286-
autophosphorylated CaMKII (19). Binding of CaMKII to the Drosophila eag K+ 
channel leads to an analogous constitutive activation of CaMKII (232). The amino 
acid sequence of the NR2B/C and the eag binding site are similar to the T286 region. 
We hypothesize that displacement of T286 from the T site (Section 2.1.2) allows 
stable binding of NR2B/C or eag with this site to prevent re-association of not only 
T286 with the T site but also the pseudosubstrate region with the S site. These 
interactions would in this way confer autophosphorylation-independent autonomous 
activity, which in turn could promote T286 phosphorylation of a neighboring 
Ca2+/CaM-bound subunit in the CaMKII holoenzyme. Binding to NR2B/C or eag 
could, thereby, locally spark autonomous activity when a limited amount of 
Ca2+/CaM is available. However, S1303 in NR2B/C is a CaMKII phosphorylation 
site (180) and NR2B/C can also interact with catalytic sites in a not fully understood 
complex manner to inhibit CaMKII activity under certain conditions (197). 
2.2 Postsynaptic Targeting of PKA by AKAPs 
PKA is a tetramer that consists of two dimerized regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) 
subunits. Four genes encode RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ and three genes Cα, Cβ, and 
Cγ (33, 65). Cγ is only detectable in testis. Binding to R dimers inhibits catalytic 
activity of C subunits until their release by cAMP binding to R. RII and to a lesser 
extent RI associate with a number of substrates via A kinase anchor proteins 
(AKAPs) (37, 204, 264). AKAPs are diverse proteins that range from 15 to >300 
kDa in size but share 14–18 residue long amphipathic α helices that bind the R 
dimer. 
 
Full activation of C subunits requires their release from R subunits by cAMP, 
which should displace C from AKAP – RII complexes and thereby reduce 
phosphorylation of the targeted proteins. In fact, prolonged stimulation via cAMP of 
Cav1.1 reduces its potentiation by PKA consistent with dislocation of the C subunit"

from the channel – AKAP (here AKAP7 previously know as AKAP15/18) – R 
subunit complex (110). However, C subunits can be activated by cAMP without 
fully dissociating from RII subunits (252, 274). Incomplete dissociation might keep 
C subunits anchored near their substrates. RI isoforms, which are anchored to a 
lesser degree than RII, appear to more fully release their C subunit during substrate 
phosphorylation in vitro (252). 
2.2.1 Postsynaptic Localization of AKAP5 and its Function 
Rodent AKAP150, human AKAP79, and bovine AKAP75 are orthologs and were 
recently re-named AKAP5. AKAP150 differs from AKAP75/79 by an insert of 36 
imperfect octapeptide repeats of unknown function (204). AKAP5 is the main 
AKAP that targets PKA to postsynaptic sites (88, 142, 264). Removal of its PKA 
anchoring site reduces the PKA content of postsynaptic densities by 70–80% (142). 
AKAP5 binds to the SH3 and GK domain of PSD-95 and its homolog SAP97 (48, 
237) (Fig. 3). PSD-95 interacts directly with the NMDA receptor and via stargazin 
or its homologs with AMPA receptors (Chapter by Kennedy et al., this volume). 
SAP97 binds to the C terminus of AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit (123) thereby 
bridging AKAP5 and associated PKA with GluR1 (237, 264) (Fig. 3). Disruption of 
AKAP-mediated PKA anchoring leads to run-down of AMPA receptor-mediated 
excitatory postsynaptic currents (203). PKA-mediated phosphorylation of S845 on 
GluR1 requires its association with PKA via AKAP5 and SAP97 is a critical linker 
(237). Anchored PKA increases channel activity (12), surface expression, and 
postsynaptic accumulation of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors (74, 150, 175). 
The role of PSD-95/AKAP5–anchored PKA in NMDA receptor regulation is less 
clear. 
 
AKAP5 also interacts with PKC and the Ca2+/CaM-activated phosphatase 
calcineurin (PP2B) (45, 115). AKAP5 is critical for reversal of PKA-mediated 
GluR1 upregulation by PP2B (220, 237). Although PKA, PKC, and PP2B regulate 
NMDA receptor activity (134, 140, 195, 219) (Sections 2.2.3 and 2.3.1) it is 
unknown whether these effects depend partially or fully on their anchoring by 
AKAP5. 
 
AKAP5 also binds to F-actin, cadherin, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-
bisphosphate (PIP2; Fig. 3), all of which are present if not enriched at postsynaptic 
sites and can thereby contribute to its postsynaptic localization (59, 88, 89). It is thus 
difficult to precisely define whether a certain interaction is especially critical for 
targeting AKAP5 in general to postsynaptic sites or specifically to defined PKA 
substrates. Furthermore, a 3 min stimulation of Ca2+ influx through the NMDA 
receptor, which induces LTD, leads to redistribution of postsynaptic AKAP5 to the 
cytoplasm in a PP2B-dependent fashion (88, 102, 220). This Ca2+ influx also reduces 
the postsynaptic content of F-actin and PSD-95 but not cadherin (49, 88, 89, 220). In 
addition, PKC as well as Ca2+/CaM inhibit AKAP5 binding to F-actin, cadherin, 
PIP2, and PSD-95 (88, 89, 220). Stabilization of F-actin by jasplakinolide inhibits 
AKAP5 relocalization and dissociation from PSD-95 (88, 220). Furthermore, 
inhibition of phospholipase C to prevent PIP2 hydrolysis blocks the Ca2+ influx-
induced dispersal of AKAP5, F-actin, and PSD-95 (102). It thus appears that 
multiple interactions that foster each other are required for proper postsynaptic"

The model shows the N-terminal region with three stretches rich in basic residues (green),

are indicated in yellow and red, respectively. (b) Model of AKAP interactions at the

AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit. SAP97 and PSD-95 bind with their C-terminal portions 
consisting of SH3 and GK domains to AKAP5 (red) but precise interaction sites have proven 
difficult to dissect. AKAP5 anchoring of PKA and PP2B is required for phosphorylation and 
dephosphorylation of S845 (orange P). Center shows the complex between the NMDA 
receptor, AKAP9 (present at postsynaptic sites as yotiao, the shorter splice variant of 
AKAP350), and AKAP5. AKAP9 binds to the C1 segment in the NR1 C-terminus. It 
functionally recruits not only PKA but also the antagonistic phosphatase PP1 to the NMDA 
receptor. AKAP5 binds to PSD-95 (or its homologs), which in turn interact with the very  
C-terminal ESDL-COO– motif of NR2A and 2B. The role of AKAP5 in NMDA receptor 
regulation is unknown. Left side outlines the β2-adrenergic receptor (AR) – adenylyl cyclase –

AKAP5 targeting. RII but not PP2B re-distribute upon Ca2+ influx in parallel with 
AKAP5 (88, 220). The function of AKAP5 and PKA relocalization is unclear but 
could contribute to downregulation of signaling pathways that otherwise lead to 
overstimulation. The observation that dephosphorylation of GluR1 on its PKA site 
S845 precedes persistent AKAP5 relocation during chemically induced LTD is 
compatible with AKAP5 being important for linking PP2B to GluR1 (220). PKA 
will be displaced in parallel with AKAP5, thereby preventing GluR1 
rephosphorylation in this form of LTD. 
2.2.2 The β2Adrenergic Receptor – Adenylyl Cyclase – Gs – AKAP5 – PKA – 
Cav1.2 Signaling Complex 
The L-type Ca2+ channel Cav1.2 regulates neuronal excitability and gene expression 
and triggers cardiac contraction. β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) stimulate via Gs, 
adenylyl cyclase, and PKA Cav1.2 currents during the fight or flight response (21, 
181, 196) in part by phosphorylation of S1928 in the central Cav1.2 subunit α11.2 
(93, 179). Cav1.2 is concentrated at postsynaptic sites of glutamatergic and 
GABAergic synapses (55, 97, 173) where it contributes to Ca2+ influx especially 
upon β-AR stimulation (101). L-type channels mediate a portion of LTP induced by 
high frequency tetani (92) (Chapter by Lisman and Hell, this volume) and of 
activity-induced homeostasis of synaptic transmission by suppressing GluR1 
expression (242). 
 
AKAP5 and AKAP7 (AKAP15/18) bind directly to Cav1.2 for PKA-mediated 
regulation of Cav1.2 in brain (93, 179) and heart, respectively (108). This spatial 
confinement of PKA signaling extends in the case of Cav1.2 beyond the kinase: the 
Cav1.2 also contains the β2-AR, Gs, and adenylyl cyclase (11, 55). The C-terminus of 
the β2-AR directly binds to the central, pore-forming α11.2 subunit (55). It is unclear 
how Gs and adenylyl cyclase are linked to Cav1.2. AKAP5 binds adenylyl cyclase 5 
and 6 (18) and could thereby recruit one or both isoforms to Cav1.2. During cell-
attached patch clamp recording, administration of a β2-AR- agonist increases L-type- 
currents by more than two fold inside, but not outside, the recording pipette 
electrode in neurons (55) and cardiomyocytes (42) via PKA (6, 101, 179, 268, 278). 
These results suggest that cAMP signaling can be restricted to sub-μm dimensions. 
 
Mechanisms of cAMP compartmentalization are not fully understood but 
involve cAMP hydrolysis by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) (224, 268). Some AKAPs 
interact with PDEs (23) and different PDE4 isoforms are recruited to activated β2 -
ARs via β arrestin for localized breakdown of cAMP (10, 192). In the heart cGMP-
inhibited cAMP PDEs (PDE3 family) and the cAMP-specific PDEs (PDE4 family) 
contribute to the spatial restricted regulation of Cav1.2 by the β2-AR (111, 199). The 
abundant PDE4D3 isoform binds to AKAP6 (mAKAP) (64, 66), the longer splice 
form of AKAP9 (AKAP350) (236) and AKAP12 (gravin, AKAP250) (263). Co-
localization of PDE4D with PKA by AKAPs fosters phosphorylation of PDE4D by 
PKA to stimulate cAMP hydrolysis (51, 66). 
 
Like AKAP5, AKAP12 binds to the β2-AR C-terminus for agonist-induced 
internalization of the β2-AR and also recovery of the β2-AR from this desensitization 
(76, 132, 216). AKAP5 and 12 also anchor of PKC and PP2B. Both AKAPs can"

interact with negatively charged phospholipids via three basic segments in their N-
terminal regions and Ca2+/CaM antagonizes these interactions (59, 88, 235, 256). 
2.2.3 The Role of AKAP9 in NMDA Receptor Regulation 
Yotiao is a smaller splice isoform of AKAP350/450 now called AKAP9. It binds to 
the C1 cassette in the C-terminus of the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors (262). It 
recruits PKA to upregulate currents through the NMDA receptor (262). A recent 
report indicates that PKA acts mainly by selectively increasing Ca2+ permeability of 
the NMDA receptor (219). AKAP9 also links the phosphatase PP1 to the NMDA 
receptor to counteract the PKA effect (262). Anchoring of PKA and a phosphatase 
by AKAP9 is analogous to AKAP5, which links PKA and PP2B to GluR1 (220, 
237) and Cav1.2 (179). However, PKA-mediated upregulation of Cav1.2 is not only 
counterbalanced by AKAP5-anchored PP2B but also by PP2A, which requires a 
direct stable association with Cav1.2 (56, 94) (Section 3.3.2). 
2.3 PSD-95 as a Hub for Targeting PKC, Pyk2, Src, and Fyn 
2.3.1 Regulation of the NMDA Receptor by PKC – Pyk2 – Src 
Gq-coupled receptors including the metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1 and 5 
activate phospholipase Cγ for hydrolysis of PIP2 to inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 
and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 induces Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. DAG 
can either alone or in conjunction with Ca2+ stimulate most PKC isoforms. 
Conventional PKCα, PKCβ, and PKCγ isoforms are activated when DAG or Ca2+ 
bind to the conserved C1 and C2 domains, respectively (164, 172). Novel isoforms 
(PKCδ, PKCε, PKCη, PKCθ) have no C2 domain and require only DAG but not 
Ca2+ for full activation. Atypical isoforms (human PKCι, mouse PKCλ, PKCζ) lack 
C1 and C2 domains and their regulation is not well understood. 
 
PKC increases surface expression, opening probability (119), and peak currents 
of NMDA receptors (141). However, PKC can also decrease steady state currents by 
increasing inactivation (140). PKC can directly act on the NMDA receptor to reduce 
steady state currents and through Pyk2 and Src or related kinases (SRKs) to increase 
peak currents (140, 141). Inhibition of Src prevents PKC- and also Pyk2-induced 
increases in NMDA receptor peak currents and inhibition of Pyk2 abrogates PKC- 
but not Src-induced increases in NMDA receptor peak currents (106, 140, 141). 
These results place Pyk2 downstream of PKC and upstream of Src. 
 
Pyk2 is a close homolog of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK). It consists of a Band 
4.1 homology domain, a region with Y402 for autophosphorylation, which is part of 
the activation process, the kinase domain, a region with two proline-rich segments, 
and the Focal Adhesion Targeting (FAT) domain (9, 125, 209, 275). It is present in 
dendrites (159, 211). Pyk2 can indirectly be activated by PKC or by Ca2+ influx. 
Pyk2 links Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors and Ca2+ channels and activation of 
a number of Gq coupled receptors including mGluR1 and 5 to signaling via tyrosine 
phosphorylation pathways (60, 63, 70, 86, 106, 125, 206). The precise mechanisms 
of Pyk2 activation are unclear. In contrast to FAK, Pyk2 can be activated 
independently of Src (186, 265) (but see (43, 222))."
172,"===== Page 16 =====
474 
S. Strack and J.W. Hell 
 
 
Autophosphorylation of Pyk2 on Y402 allows binding of the SH2 domain of 
Src to promote Src activation (63, 206). Src then phosphorylates Y579 and Y580 in 
the activation loop to fully activity Pyk2 (8, 17, 63, 125, 128). Src activation by 
Pyk2 upregulates NMDA receptor peak currents likely through phosphorylation of 
NR2 subunits (41, 106, 116, 206, 260). This NMDA receptors regulation is 
important for LTP that depends on Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor (106, 
143, 206, 269). 
2.3.2 Binding of PKC, Pyk2, Src to PSD-95 and ND2 
Postsynaptic anchoring mechanisms exist for all three kinases. PKCα has a C-
terminal type I PDZ domain binding motif (ETAV- COO–; critical moieties in bold). 
This motif mediates PKCα binding to PICK1 and PSD-95. PICK1 is another 
postsynaptic structural protein that contains a PDZ domain and was first identified as 
a PKCα interacting protein (223). It plays a critical role in promoting AMPA 
receptor trafficking involving PKC, although precise mechanisms are not known 
(e.g., (139, 267)). PSD-95 also interacts with one ore more of its three PDZ domains 
with PKCα (130). PSD-95 is of special interest in the context of the PKC – Pyk2 – 
Src pathway because it also binds with its somewhat unusual SH3 domain to Pyk2 
(211) and with its N-terminal region in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner to the 
SH2 domain of Src (112). Like PSD-95, Src and Pyk2 co-immunoprecipitate with 
the NMDA receptor (211, 276). PSD-95 might thus link PKCα, Pyk2, and Src to the 
NMDA receptor. A second potential linker is RACK1, initially identified as binding 
protein for activated PKCβ (200). RACK1 also binds Src (40) and the related Fyn 
(271) and thus can provide a scaffold that links these two tyrosine kinases with 
PKCβ. However, PSD-95 and RACK1 binding suppresses Src and Fyn activity (40, 
112, 271). It is possible that RACK1 functions in anchoring Src and Fyn at 
postsynaptic sites and that certain stimuli relax the inhibitory interaction as occurring 
for PKA C subunits upon their release from AKAP-anchored R subunits by cAMP 
(see above). The unique domain of Src also binds to the NADH dehydrogenase 
subunit 2 (85). ND2 is a mitochondrial protein but remarkably is also present outside 
mitochondria at postsynaptic sites and required for regulation of NMDA receptors 
by Src (85). Binding to ND2 does not block Src activity. 
3 Targeting of Phosphatases to Postsynaptic Sites 
3.1 Phosphatase Classification 
The human genome encodes more than 500 protein kinases but only ~140 protein 
phosphatases (5, 151). This ratio has been interpreted as evidence for greater 
promiscuity of phosphatases compared to kinases. However, PP1 and PP2A exist as 
multimeric enzymes composed of catalytic and variable regulatory subunits, thereby 
increasing the complexity of the “phosphatome” considerably. 
 
Protein phosphatases are classified according to catalytic mechanisms as metal-
based, Cys-based, or Asp-based phosphatases. Further divisions are based on 
sequence and structural similarities. The metal-based phosphatases are specific for"

phospho-Ser/Thr and belong to two groups, PPP and PPM. The PPP group includes 
the catalytic subunits of PP1, PP2A, PP2B (calcineurin), and PP4-7. The PPM (or 
PP2C) family consists of magnesium-dependent protein phosphatases, which have 
some structural similarity to PPP-class catalytic domains. PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and 
PP2C account for the majority of Ser/Thr phosphatase activity and are abundant 
proteins, particularly in brain. The more recently identified PP4 through PP7 are less 
abundant and may have relatively narrow substrate specificities. 
 
Cys-based phosphatases feature a conserved catalytic motif (CX5R) and are 
classified into four groups (5). Similar to Tyr kinases, the protein Tyr phosphatase 
(PTP) group can be further divided into receptor and non-receptor PTPs. The Asp-
based phosphatases are characterized by a catalytic motif containing two aspartates 
(DXDXT). This growing group of Tyr/Ser phosphatases contains the eyes absent 
(Eya) transcription factors and a cofilin phosphatase. 
 
Here we will discuss synaptic functions of the widely studied PPP group of 
Ser/Thr phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2B). The reader is referred to excellent 
reviews for more information on tyrosine phosphatases in the brain (32, 188). 
3.2 Protein Phosphatase PP1 
Together with PP2A, PP1 contributes about 90% of phospho-Ser/Thr directed 
activity in most cell types. The PP1 catalytic subunit is a ~36 kD globular protein 
that is highly conserved from yeast to man. In mammals, there are four PP1 isoforms 
(α, β/δ, γ1, γ2) encoded by three genes (α-γ). PP1γ1 and PP1γ2 arise by differential 
splicing from the same gene. The C-termini of PP1 isoforms display the most 
sequence variability and may contribute to isoform-specific association with 
regulatory proteins (38). 
 
The crystal structure of the PP1 catalytic subunit complexed with a regulatory 
protein, myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1), illustrates how regulatory 
subunits confer substrate specificity (Fig. 4b–e). The PP1/MYPT1 complex mediates 
smooth muscle contraction through dephosphorylation of the myosin regulatory 
chain, but has also a critical role in cerebellar LTD by dephosphorylating Ser880 of 
GluR2 (75). MYPT1 extends the substrate binding pocket of PP1 with an acidic 
groove, which may help attract substrates with clusters of basic residues next to the 
phospho-Ser/Thr (239). 
 
Neuronal roles of the PP1 targeting/regulatory subunits spinophilin, neurabin, 
and DARPP-32 are well established. DARPP-32 knockout mice are largely 
unaffected by several drugs of abuse, underscoring the importance of this protein in 
 
Free PP1 catalytic subunits are not known to exist in significant quantities in 
cells; rather they form complexes with more than 50 binding partners (Fig. 4a). PP1 
regulatory proteins determine the physiological functions of specific PP1 
holoenzymes. They can be classified into substrate-independent activity modulators 
(e.g., inhibitor-1, inhibitor-2, dopamine and cAMP-dependent phosphoprotein of 32 
kDa (DARPP-32)), and targeting subunits/substrate specifiers (e.g., spinophilin, 
neurabin). Binding of many PP1 associated proteins involves an “RVXF” motif that 
slots into a hydrophobic pocket on the catalytic subunit. The actual consensus 
sequence for PP1 binding is [K/R]X0–1[I/V]<P>[F/W], where X can be any residue 
and <P> can be any residue but proline (38)."

psychostimulant action. However, because DARPP-32 is not believed to be enriched 
at synapses, the reader is referred to several excellent reviews on DARPP-32 (29, 
233). In the following, we will discuss the synaptically targeted PP1 regulatory 
proteins spinophilin/neurabin II and neurabin. 
 
 
Fig. 4. Regulatory subunits determine PP1 substrate specificity. (a) Four closely related PP1 
catalytic subunits (PP1c α, β, γ1, γ2) associate with a growing list of anchoring and regulatory 
proteins to dephosphorylate proteins in a variety of cellular locations (bolded). Most PP1 
regulatory proteins contain an RVxF motif that contributes to the interaction with PP1c. (b) 
PP1c is a globular protein with a C-terminal extension. Three groves (C-terminal, acidic and 
hydrophobic grove) form a Y-shaped catalytic surface (yellow) with catalysis occurring in the

3.2.1 Synaptic Targeting of PP1 by Spinophilin and Neurabin 
Neurabin (neurabin I; neuronal actin binder) and spinophilin (also known as 
neurabin II) were initially identified in neurons as PP1 and actin-associated proteins"

(3, 145, 170, 210). They are scaffold proteins that share overall 50% sequence 
similarity and a multi-domain architecture consisting of an N-terminal actin binding 
domain, a central PP1 binding motif (KI[K/H]F), a PDZ domain, and a C-terminal 
coiled-coil domain (Fig. 5). Spinophilin and neurabin form homo- and hetero-
oligomers through their coiled-coil domains and associate with PP1 in a 1:1 
stoichiometric ratio (145). In addition to PP1 and filamentous actin, spinophin/ 
neurabin assemble complexes with several other proteins, including p70S6K, guanyl 
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) 
proteins (Fig. 5; for a detailed review of spinophilin interactors see (208)). Binding 
of PP1 and p70S6K to neurabin are mutually exclusive (178). It is unknown which of 
the other interactions can occur simultaneously.

receptor and several α adrenergic receptors. Spinophilin/neurabin has therefore been 
proposed as an adapter complex that links the cortical cytoskeleton to receptors in 
the plasma membrane. Indeed, spinophilin has been shown to stabilize GPCRs at the 
cell surface (31), and regulates GPCR signaling by competing with arrestin for 
binding to the 3iL and recruiting RGS proteins to the receptor complex (257–259). 
 
Whereas neurabin is found exclusively in neurons (170), spinophilin is 
expressed in many mammalian tissues (3, 210). Both are highly enriched in dendritic 
spines and co-fractionate with the PSD (3, 145, 170, 210). Neurabin, but not 
spinophilin, has also been localized to subsets of presynaptic terminals (168, 169). 
While both proteins are believed to target PP1 to key synaptic substrates, specific 
interaction partners and the differential localization of the two proteins may be 
responsible for the different phenotypes of spinophilin and neurabin knockout mice 
(see below). 
 
A significant fraction, possibly as much as 60% of PP1 in certain brain regions 
exists in complexes with spinophilin and neurabin, because single knockouts 
decrease PP1 catalytic subunit content in homogenates of the striatum by ~30% (4). 
A similar decrease in PP1 content was observed in the synaptoneurosome fraction of 
hippocampal slice cultures infected with virus expressing a dominant-negative 
neurabin construct (104). Taking into account that presumably only a fraction of 
neurons expressed the dominant-negative construct, these experiments suggest that 
neurabin and spinophilin are largely responsible for targeting PP1 to dendritic 
spines. 
3.2.2 Spinophilin and Neurabin in Cytoskeletal Dynamics and Spine Formation 
The N-terminal F-actin binding domain is necessary and sufficient for the 
localization of spinophilin and neurabin to dendritic spines, and spine targeting of 
neurabin requires an intact actin cytoskeleton (13, 90, 279). Expression of the 
isolated F-actin binding domain of spinophilin/neurabin induces reorganization of 
the actin cytoskeleton and filopodial outgrowth in cultured neurons (178, 240). The 
neurabin N-terminus increases the density of innervated dendritic spines in cultured 
hippocampal slices (279). It is unclear whether these phenotypes are a non-specific 
consequence of the actin bundling activity of this domain (170, 210), or whether 
they result from a dominant-negative displacement of endogenous actin associated 
proteins, because overexpression of full-length spinophilin/neurabin did not have an 
effect.  
 
Further evidence suggests that spinophilin and neurabin are important for the 
morphological differentiation of neurons. Gene knockout of spinophilin causes a 
transient increase in dendritic spine density in vivo and excessive filopodial 
extensions in vitro (77). While data on spine development in neurabin knockout 
mice are not available, expression of a PP1 binding-deficient neurabin mutant delays 
the maturation of dendritic filopodia into spines (240). Spinophilin/neurabin may 
also affect F-actin organization and spine morphology independent of PP1 through 
recruitment of the Rho GEFs kalirin-7 and Lcf (191, 205). 
 
Spinophilin also regulates the neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton. Doublecortin, 
the protein product of the disease gene for the human neuronal migration disorder 
double cortex and X-linked lissencephaly, is a microtubule-associated protein that 
also interacts with the coiled-coil region of spinophilin (26, 248). By"

dephosphorylating doublecortin at S297, PP1-spinophilin stabilizes microtubule 
bundles at the transition zone between growth cone and axonal shaft. Neurons from 
doublecortin or spinophilin knockouts have splayed or unevenly spaced 
microtubules, and the double knockout exacerbated this defect and additionally 
prevented axons from crossing the midline to form the corpus callosum (26). 
3.2.3 Spinophilin and Neurabin in Synaptic Transmission and Plasticity 
PP1 is critical for the induction of LTD in the hippocampus and other brain areas. 
LTD-inducing stimuli promote translocation of PP1 into spines, coinciding with the 
dephosphorylation and internalization of AMPA receptors (71, 121, 165). Inhibition 
of PP1 activity or displacing PP1 from its targeting subunits (for instance with an 
“RVXF” motif-containing peptide) blocks LTD (165, 166). 
 
Recent results suggested that neurabin targets PP1 to dendritic spines of CA1 
hippocampal neurons to regulate surface expression of specific pools of AMPA 
receptors (104). Neurabin-targeted PP1 tonically stabilizes basal synaptic 
transmission by dephosphorylating GluR2 at S880, thereby preventing the 
interaction of GluR2 with PICK1 and the internalization of GluR2-containing 
AMPA receptors. During LTD, neurabin recruits PP1 into the vicinity of GluR1 
containing AMPA-receptors, resulting in the dephosphorylation of GluR1 on S831 
and S845, which in turn reduces single channel activity and surface expression of 
GluR1-containing AMPA receptors (Section 2). In this study, endogenous PP1-
neurabin complexes were displaced with a “dominant-negative” mutant that binds to 
actin, but not PP1 (neurabin1–490F460A), which may also displace PP1-spinophilin 
complexes from the F-actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines. Given that spinophilin 
knockout mice are deficient in hippocampal LTD (77), it is possible that spinophilin 
and neurabin have at least partially overlapping functions at hippocampal synapses. 
 
Knockout mice show that spinophilin and neurabin have distinct functions in 
dopamine-mediated plasticity (4). Deletion of neurabin blocks AMPA receptor 
potentiation by the D1 dopamine receptor in prefrontal cortex and striatum, whereas 
spinophilin deletion shows this defect only in the striatum. While neurabin knockout 
mice are deficient in corticostriatal LTP, spinophilin knockout mice lack LTD at this 
synapse. Supporting a role in AMPA receptor dephosphorylation, both knockout 
strains displayed enhanced induction of GluR1 S845 phosphorylation by D1-
receptor activation. Interestingly, basal GluR1 S845 phosphorylation was reduced in 
both knockout mice, which is consistent with biochemical studies showing that 
spinophilin and neurabin are potent PP1 inhibitors in vitro (103, 145, 156). A factor 
that complicates the interpretation of these knockout studies is that both neurabin 
and spinophilin have been implicated in dendritic spine formation (77, 240). 
3.3 PP2A and its Localization in Neurons 
PP2A constitutes between 0.3 and 1% of total protein in mammalian cells. It 
supplies most of the soluble Ser/Thr phosphatase activity (100, 109). PP2A exists 
predominantly as a holoenzyme formed by three subunits. A 36 kDa catalytic or C 
subunit complexes with a 65 kDa scaffolding A subunit to form the AC core 
enzyme; the core enzyme binds a third, variable B subunit to form the ABC"

holoenzyme (Fig. 6). In mammals, A and C subunits are each encoded by two highly 
similar genes (Aα/β, Cα/β), with Aα and Cα isoforms being more abundant. 
Regulatory subunits are encoded by three multi-gene families, referred to as B, B’, 
proteins with molecular masses of ~55 kDa (96, 155, 184, 226, 280). The B’ family 
(also referred to as B56 or PR61) consists of at least 7 isoforms encoded by five 
genes (B’α, B’β, B’γ, B’δ, and B’ε) (52, 157, 158, 234, 238, 281), with molecular 
masses between 54 and 74 kDa. There are at least four members of the B” family, 
designated according to their size as PR48 (273), PR59 (253), and PR72/130 (98). 
PR72 and PR130 are splice- or promoter-use variants of the same gene. Several 
PP2A regulatory subunits show restricted tissue expression; in particular, Bβ1, Bβ2, 
and Bγ can only be detected in brain, and B’β and B’δ are enriched in brain (155, 
231, 280). 
 
 
Fig. 6. The PP2A heterotrimer. Three families of regulatory subunits associate with the AC 
core dimer to form a spectrum of heterotrimeric PP2A holoenzymes. The heterotrimer 
structure was derived by X-ray crystallography (44, 270), while structures of the B- and B” 
family subunits are based on homology modeling. 
 
 
Whereas the PP1 catalytic subunit is enriched in PSD preparations, the PP2A C 
subunit is found in the synaptosomal fraction, but depleted when this fraction is 
extracted with nonionic detergent to prepare the PSD (225). Evidence is 
accumulating that regulatory subunits target PP2A to specific subcellular locations 
and substrates in neurons. For instance, members of the B-family of regulatory 
and B”. The B family consists of 4 genes, Bα, Ββ, Βγ, and Βδ, that give rise to"

subunits were localized to discrete neuronal populations and exhibited differences in 
dendritic, axonal, and somatic localization and subcellular fractionation profiles 
(231). The brain-enriched PP2A/B’β complex specifically dephosphorylates and 
inactivates tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine 
synthesis. PP2A/B’β was largely restricted to the somata of dopaminergic neurons in 
the substantia nigra and could not be detected in dopaminergic terminal fields in the 
striatum, which correlated with regional differences in tyrosine hydroxylase 
phosphorylation. B’β may curb dopamine synthesis and build-up of toxic 
metabolites of catecholamine at non-synaptic sites (207). Even though PP2A has 
been shown to regulate several pre- and postsynaptic proteins, the identity of the 
regulatory subunits that recruit the phosphatase holoenzyme to synapses remains to 
be established. 
3.3.1 PP2A in Synaptic Plasticity 
Compared to PP1 and PP2B, relatively little is known about the role of PP2A in 
synaptic function. The majority of studies implicating PP2A in synaptic transmission 
and plasticity employed pharmacological inhibitors such as okadaic acid or 
fostriecin, rather than inhibitory proteins or genetic tools. Even though okadaic acid 
inhibits PP2A at 10-fold lower concentration than PP1 in vitro, it is often applied at 
non-selective concentrations to overcome the slow uptake of the drug into cells. 
 
Perhaps the best evidence for an involvement of PP2A derives from studying 
synaptic plasticity between granule and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, which is 
thought to be critical for motor learning. Contrasting LTP/LTD in the CA1 region of 
the hippocampus, cerebellar LTD requires kinase activation and phosphatase 
inactivation (146), whereas LTP requires the activity of multiple phosphatases, 
including PP2A (24). In dissociated cerebellar cultures, specific inhibition of 
postsynaptic PP2A induces synaptic depression that occludes electrically-evoked 
LTD. Synaptic depression was use-dependent and was associated with declustering 
or internalization of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors(120). Available data point 
to a developmental switch in the phosphatases whose inhibition mediates cerebellar 
LTD, with PP2A playing the major role in mature cerebellar cultures (>22 DIV), and 
PP1 dominating in younger cultures (75, 120). 
PP2A forms complexes with several ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, 
which often contain an opposing kinase, to increase the spatial and temporal fidelity 
and specificity of signaling events in response to discretely localized stimuli. 
 
Phosphorylation of the Ca2+ channel CaV1.2 on S1928 by PKA increases its 
activity. PP2A containing B’ and B”, but not B-family regulatory subunits interacts 
with a region downstream of this phosphorylation site to downregulate Cav1.2 phos-
phorylation and activity (94). The N-type Ca2+ channel (CaV2.2) mediates neuro-
transmitter release from nerve terminals. It binds the PP2A scaffolding A subunit, 
although the functional consequences of this association were not studied (114). 
 
Intracellular Ca2+ release channels are also intimately associated with the 
phosphatase. The ryanodine receptor RyR2 contains three leucine-isoleucine zipper 
(LIZ) motifs. One mediates PP2A binding, possibly through the B” regulatory 
3.3.2 Complexes of PP2A with Ca2+ Channels and the NMDA Receptor"

subunit PR130 (154). AKAP6 (mAKAP) binds to the second LIZ and spinophilin to 
the third LIZ motif in RyR2 (154). AKAP6-anchored PKA increases open 
probability of RyR2, which is opposed by PP2A and PP1. RyR1 in skeletal muscle 
lacks the LIZ motif that mediates PP2A binding, and therefore assembles selectively 
with PP1 and PKA (154). The neuronal isoform of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphatase 
receptor (IP3R1) exists as a similar supramolecular signaling complex with PP1, 
PP2A, and PKA (62). AKAP9 (yotiao) recruits both PKA and PP1 to the IP3R1, 
whereas PP2A could assemble into the complex through AKAP450, a longer splice 
variant of AKAP9/yotiao (249). The relative importance of the two phosphatases in 
intracellular Ca2+ channel regulation remains to be investigated. 
 
Recruitment of PKA and PP1 to the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit via 
AKAP9/yotiao (262) has been described above in Section 3.3. Yeast two-hybrid 
screening identified the PP2A catalytic subunit as an interaction partner for the C-
terminus of NR3A subunit (39, 144). Whereas NR1 and NR2 form Ca2+-permeable 
NMDA receptors, receptors containing NR1 and NR3 function as Ca2+-impermeable 
excitatory glycine receptors during development (185). NR3A associates with PP2A 
in brain lysates and thereby mediates dephosphorylation of NR1 at S897 (39, 144). 
3.3.3 Regulation of CaMKII by PP2A 
Autophosphorylation of CaMKII confers Ca2+-independent activity and is critical for 
LTP (Section 2 and Chapter by Lisman and Hell, this volume). Autophosphorylation 
at T305 or T306 in the CaM binding region will keep CaMKII inactive by 
preventing its activation through Ca2+/CaM binding. There are additional in vivo 
autophosphorylation sites (e.g., T253) with unclear functional relevance (67, 163). 
 
PP1 and PP2A dephosphorylate CaMKII in different subcellular locations (PSD 
vs. cytosolic fractions, respectively) (14, 68, 225). This compartment-specific 
dephosphorylation is maintained when soluble or PSD-associated CaMKII are 
incubated with excess phosphatase in vitro, suggesting that conformational changes 
or local accessibility of CaMKII dictate selectivity for PP1 vs. PP2A (225, 227). 
Recent evidence suggests that T286 in PSD-associated CaMKII is somehow 
protected from dephosphorylation, and that PSD-bound PP1 dephosphorylates 
CaMKII at other sites (167). The identity of the CaMKII T305/306 phosphatase is 
less well defined, but genetic reduction of PP2A activity increases inhibitory 
autophosphorylation of CaMKII in Drosophila (138). Therefore, available evidence 
points to PP2A as the principal phosphatase that opposes autophosphorylation of 
CaMKII at both stimulatory (T286) and inhibitory (T305/306) sites. 
 
LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is associated with a decrease in 
PP2A activity, as shown with 32P-labeled CaMKII as an in vitro substrate (79). LTP 
is accompanied by an increase in CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of B’β subunit 
of PP2A (denoted as B’α in that report according to older nomenclature). 
Phosphorylation of B’β inhibited its activity towards T286-autophosphorylated 
CaMKII in vitro, suggesting a negative feedback mechanism in which autonomous 
CaMKII inactivates its modulator for persistent Ca2+/CaM -independent activity 
during LTP (79). Recently, dimeric PP2A containing the α4 subunit was found to 
associate with cytosolic CaMKII, and neuron-specific α4 knockout mice displayed 
learning and memory deficits and increased Ca2+/CaM-dependent CaMKII activity."
181,"===== Page 25 =====
Postsynaptic Targeting of Protein Kinases and Phosphatases
483
 
However, Ca2+-independent activity was unchanged in the α4 knockout, leaving it 
unclear as to exactly how the PP2A/α4 dimer regulates the kinase (272). 
 
The importance of phosphatases in returning CaMKII to its basal, Ca2+/CaM 
responsive state is illustrated by the molecular etiology of Angelman syndrome, a 
developmental disorder characterized by mental retardation and seizures. Angelman 
syndrome can be caused by loss of function of the maternal copy of the UBE3A 
gene, which, due to brain region-specific imprinting, is the only copy expressed in 
the hippocampus and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (54, 72). UBE3A codes for the 
E3A ubiquitin ligase. The few identified substrates have yet to be tied to the 
pathology. Mice with a maternally inherited UBE3A mutation display Angelman 
disease-like symptoms and show hyperphosphorylation of CaMKII at T286 and 
T305. CaMKII hyperphosphorylation correlated with reduced phosphatase activity 
in the hippocampus, most likely PP2A (261). Connecting dysregulated CaMKII 
phosphorylation to the disease, the neurological symptoms could be rescued by 
crossing Angelman syndrome mice with mice expressing a mutant CaMKII that 
cannot undergo inhibitory autophosphorylation (T305V/T306A) (251). 
3.4.1 Basic Features and Functions of PP2B 
PP2B is a ubiquitously expressed, Ca2+/CaM activated Ser/Thr phosphatase with 
particularly high levels in the somatodendritic compartment of neurons (91, 152). 
PP2B is perhaps best known as a central mediator of T lymphocyte activation and 
target for the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and cyclosporine A. The enzyme 
consists of a 60 kDa catalytic subunit (CaN-A), and a 19 kDa regulatory subunit 
(CaN-B), which has structural similarity to CaM. Three genes code for catalytic 
subunits, with Aα and Aβ being the predominant forms in brain. The regulatory 
subunit is encoded by two genes, of which only B1 is detectably expressed in 
neurons. Full activity requires both Ca2+/CaM binding to an autoinhibitory domain 
on CaN-A and Ca2+ binding to the EF hands of CaN-B. 
 
PP2B has a much lower threshold for activation by Ca2+/CaM (0.1–1 nM) than 
CaMKs including CaMKII, which might leads to the preferential activation of the 
phosphatase during LTD-inducing low frequency stimulation (165, 166). Ca2+-
dependent phosphorylation events could predominate at the higher stimulation 
frequencies that induce LTP in part because accumulation of superoxide anions upon 
Ca2+ influx results in inactivation of PP2B through oxidation of metal ions in the 
active site (27, 171). 
 
Because of steric constraints of the substrate binding region (105), PP2B has 
narrower substrate specificity than other Ser/Thr phosphatases. The number of 
PP2B-sensitive phospho-proteins is considerable because PP2B also acts indirectly 
by disinhibiting PP1. As discussed above, this disinhibition is accomplished through 
dephosphorylation of PKA sites on inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32, two cytosolic PP1 
inhibitory proteins (38). Direct and indirect (PP1-mediated) PP2B actions can be 
distinguished by pharmacological inhibition of PP1 with tautomycin or calyculin A. 
 
Many PP2B targets and anchoring proteins, including AKAP5 feature a PxIxIT 
motif (actually Px1–2IxIT) that interacts with the CaN-A subunit (7, 30, 35, 53, 58, 
179). First identified in the transcription factor NFAT, this sequence motif binds to a 
3.4 The Ca2+/CaM-Dependent Phosphatase PP2B/Calcineurin"

hydrophobic groove on CaN-A that is structurally related to the region on the PP1 
catalytic subunit, where proteins containing the RVXF motif dock (126, 127). 
PP2B is a potent modulator of excitatory neurotransmission and can downregulate 
ionotropic glutamate receptors by multiple mechanisms. NMDA receptor activity is 
negatively constrained by PP2B (129, 215, 245, 246), and this effect may be 
mediated by dephosphorylation of the NR2A subunit, possibly of S900 in its C-
terminal tail (117, 247). PP2B further decreases surface expression and single-
channel activity and of AMPA receptors, mediated through dephosphorylation 
(directly or indirectly via PP1) of S831 and S845 in the GluR1 subunit C-terminus 
(22, 121, 221, 237). Dephosphorylation of components of the endocytotic machinery 
provides an additional mechanism by which PP2B promotes internalization of 
AMPA receptors (22, 133). 
 
As discussed above (Section 2.2.1), PP2B is recruited to the AMPA receptor 
GluR1 subunit through AKAP5 via SAP97 and possibly also PSD-95 (48). These 
interactions are crucial for PP2B to antagonize upregulation of GluR1 currents by 
PKA (220, 237). AKAP5 also targets PP2B to CaV1.2 via a direct interaction of 
AKAP5 with the C-terminus of the pore-forming α1 subunit (179). In this complex, 
PP2B dominantly suppresses PKA-mediated enhancement of L-type currents. 
Strikingly, PP2B recruitment by AKAP5 is required for nuclear translocation of the 
transcription factor NFATc4/NFAT3 in response to L-type channel activation (179). 
4 Concluding Remarks 
Synapses not only transmit signals between neurons but also process signals and 
store information. Multiple signal pathways regulate the functions of central 
synapses in a highly complex manner. Many kinases and phosphatases have to be 
anchored near or at defined substrates for fast, efficient, and specific regulation of 
their phosphorylation. A true understanding of the numerous forms of synaptic 
plasticity will require the knowledge of the precise molecular interactions of kinases 
and phosphatases at synaptic sites. As discussed above, specific recruitment of 
CaMKII to postsynaptic sites that experience a period of hightened activity likely 
contributes to their potentiation. New sophisticated experimental approaches such as 
modification of kinase and phosphatase anchoring by point mutations in the mouse 
genes of anchoring proteins or, in a more acute setting, with membrane-penetrable 
peptides will help unravel the spatio-temporal organization of synaptic signaling. 
Numerous neurological and mental diseases are due to synaptic dysregulations (e.g., 
Chapters by McNamara et al., Meller and Simon, and Salter, this volume). Defining 
the exact organization of signaling pathways will pave the way for developing novel 
therapeutics for the treatment of these diseases.

1 Introduction 
Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a long-lasting strengthening of synaptic transmis-
sion that is triggered by brief periods of high-frequency synaptic stimulation. Other 
patterns of stimulation can produce a long-term weakening of synapses, a process 
termed long-term depression (LTD) or depotentiation. Synapses thus have a stable 
strength that can be bi-directionally modified in an activity-dependent manner. 
There are different forms of LTP at different brain synapses. This article focuses 
on LTP found at glutamatergic synapses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the 
most studied form of LTP. A typical experiment starts by measuring the strength of a 
group of synapses. This is done by ﬁring a single action potential in some of the 
axons that enter this region. These axons make synapses with pyramidal cells and 
generate an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). The collective strength of the 
synapses is defined by the magnitude of the average EPSP. LTP is then induced by 
stimulating the axons to ﬁre at high frequency (typically 100 Hz for 1 s), a stimulus 
referred to as a tetanus. Remarkably, this brief tetanus causes a long-lasting potentia-
tion of the strength of the synapses. The size of the EPSP typically increases by 
50%–100%, but can rise by as much as 800% in some situations. In the brain-slice 
preparation used for most studies, potentiation persists until the slice is no longer 
viable (5–12 h). LTP can also be induced in living animals, where it can persist for at 
least a year (1). 
The evidence that such changes in synaptic strength are actually involved in 
memory has strengthened in recent years. Studies have examined the effect of a 
learning experience on synapses in the hippocampus. Two groups (67, 225) have 
demonstrated that learning induces an LTP-like process, which reduces the subse-
quent ability to experimentally induce LTP at these synapses. This occlusion sug-
gests that learning-induced and experimentally-induced potentiation affect the same

Fig. 1. Model for the transitions from basal to early LTP and from early to late LTP. In this 
model postsynaptic core proteins (striped bar) anchor transsynaptic modules represented by 
the dotted line rectangles. Each such module contains vesicle release site on the presynaptic 
side. In AMPA receptor silent modules (see upper left of figure), transmission fails both be-
cause of slow release of glutamate (red dots) and because of the absence of AMPA receptors 
in the module (green and blue marked cylinders). AMPA receptors are missing because their 
anchoring slot proteins (green and blue boxes with corresponding notches) are not bound to 
each other to form a ‘hyperslot’ (lower left) that would be anchored by synaptic core proteins. 
Under basal conditions (upper left synaptic region) silent modules are interspersed with func-
tional modules. These can be identified by fast release of glutamate from vesicles (no neck and 
cloud of glutamate released) and the presence of postsynaptic AMPA receptors held in register 
by the hyperslot. AMPA receptors in the slot are in equilibrium with free AMPA receptors 
found in extrasynaptic membrane. Note that NMDA receptors (purple cylinder) are sparsely 
located on the periphery (purple slot protein) of the synapse. The small amount of glutamate 
that diffuses out of functional AMPA receptor modules is sufficient to activate these NMDA 
receptors. During early LTP (upper right synaptic region) transmission is enhanced by three 
mechanisms (inward green arrows): slow release of glutamate from a vesicle is converted to 
fast release, increasing glutamate concentration in the cleft at that module; complexes of 
AMPA receptors and hyperslots form at previously silent modules causing a step increase in 
conductance; and more AMPA receptors are inserted into the extrasynaptic membrane driving 
occupancy of hyperslot sites to higher levels. Late LTP (lower right) involves the growth of 
the synaptic region with the trans-synaptic formation of a new silent module (inward green 
arrow) and the relaxation of extrasynaptic AMPA receptor concentration to basal levels (out-
ward green arrow). Reproduced with permission from (113)."

7 LTP Maintenance: the Molecular Basis of Synaptic Memory 
7.1 The Role of CaMKII in the Maintenance of LTP 
Memory processes must involve molecules that change their state during LTP induc-
tion. This change must be persistent and have the power to affect the expression 
processes that underlie LTP. Such persistent processes constitute the maintenance 
processes. The most critical aspect of the maintenance process is stability: the stor-
age must be stable for years. Thus, whatever molecular mechanisms underlie main-
tenance can be described as a switch with stable on and off states. Whatever mole-
cules are involved in maintenance must undergo turnover, which generally occurs 
within hours or days. Thus, special mechanisms must exist that allow the state of the 
switch to be stable despite the turnover of its constituent molecules. The study of 
maintenance poses special difficulties, but one particular test is useful in distinguish-
ing maintenance from induction processes. In this test, saturating LTP is induced and 
then a drug is transiently applied. If the drug produces a reversible effect on LTP, 
then an expression processes has been affected. If the drug produces an irreversible 
effect and if additional LTP can then be induced, then the drug has, affected a main-
tenance process. 
CaMKII is a major candidate as a memory molecule because it has switch-like 
properties that make its activity persist after calcium elevation returns to baseline 
(145). This ‘memory’ occurs because Thr286 becomes autophosphorylated during 
calcium elevation (146, 196) and can persist for many hours after LTP induction 
(56). What potentially limits long-term information storage by such a process is 
spontaneous phosphatase activity, which could dephosphorylate Thr286. Further-
more, all proteins undergo protein turnover, so information stored by any one mole-
cule would be slowly eliminated by this process. Theoretical work, however, points 
to the possibility that Thr286-phosphorylated ‘on’ CaMKII holoenzymes (there are 
12 homologous subunits in a holoenzyme) could retain the on-state for many years 
(144). Dephosphorylation of Thr286 sites could be counteracted by rapid re-
phosphorylation of these sites by neighboring subunits. Cooperative interactions 
between holoenzymes could also lead to phosphorylation of holoenyzmes newly 
inserted in the process of protein turnover. In this way, information could be stably 
stored by groups of CaMKII holoenzymes (116). 
Although there are indications that CaMKII is responsible for the maintenance of 
LTP, the evidence is not yet conclusive. The strongest experiments (191) involved 
the saturation of LTP and the subsequent bath-application of a membrane-permeant 
CaMKII inhibitor. This application reduced transmission; importantly a component 
of this reduction persisted after the inhibitor was removed. At this point, it was pos-
sible to induce additional LTP, indicating that the inhibitor had reversed a process 
critical in the maintenance of LTP. 
Given the importance of CaMKII in LTP and its abundance in the PSD, it be-
comes critical to understand what happens to the enzyme within the PSD. CaMKII 
binds to a number of PSD proteins including the NMDA receptor, densin-180, and 
α-actinin (32, 142) (see Chapter by Strack and Hell). Binding to the NMDA receptor 
NR1 and NR2B subunits requires CaMKII activation by either Ca2+/calmodulin"

Once induced, binding of CaMKII to NR2B is stable even if calmodulin is re-
moved by chelating Ca2+. It can also persist if T286 autophosphorylation has not 
occurred (14). The complex between non-phosphorylated CaMKII and NR2B exhib-
its autonomous activity similar to T286-autophosphorylated CaMKII (14). Analo-
gous constitutive CaMKII activation is observed when CaMKII is associated with 
the Drosophila eag K+ channel (209). The CaMKII binding sites on NR2B and eag 
possess significant similarity with the Thr286 region. This region of CaMKII binds 
to the so-called T-site to foster intramolecular inhibition of CaMKII catalytic activity 
by placing the autohinhibitory pseudosubstrate region near the catalytic site (Chapter 
by Strack and Hell). When Thr286 is displaced from the T site by Ca2+/calmodulin, 
which binds immediately downstream of Thr286, NR2B or eag associate with the T 
site. The pseudosubstrate region then cannot re-associate with the catalytic site, 
much as occurs when Thr286 CaMKII is phosphorylated. This autophosphorylation-
independent autonomous activity may support continued CaMKII activity, in part by 
fostering Thr286 phosphorylation of neighboring subunits in the CaMKII holoen-
zyme (for this event the substrate subunit must bind Ca2+/calmodulin, but such bind-
ing can occur at a low rate even at resting Ca2+ levels). Thus, NR2B binding can 
locally support autonomous CaMKII activity when Ca2+/calmodulin is limited. Such 
activation of CaMKII would explain the lasting autonomous activity and apparent 
inaccessibility for phosphatases that CaMKII exhibits upon LTP induction (57). The 
maintenance of CaMKII phosphorylation in the PSD appears to be further supported 
by reactions that keep the phosphatase away from the Thr286 site (152, 206). 
7.2 The Role of PKMζ in Maintenance of LTP 
Evidence is accumulating that another kinase, the PKMζ isoform of PKC, has an 
important role in LTP maintenance. The concentration of this enzyme is increased 
during LTP and decreased during LTD (79). The increase of PKMζ after LTP induc-
tion is due to protein synthesis (76). The gene produces a protein that lacks a regula-
 
(NR2B) or Thr286 autophosphorylation (NR1, NR2B). Stimulation of postsynaptic 
Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors augments binding of endogenous CaMKII to 
the NMDA receptor in acute hippocampal slices (106) and postsynaptic clustering of 
GFP-tagged CaMKII in primary hippocampal cultures (200). LTP produces a persis-
tent translocation of CaMKII from the cytoplasm to the synapse (170). Such translo-
cation is driven specifically by Ca2+calmodulin influx through the NMDA receptor 
(214). One surprising aspect of the translocation process is that the Thr286Asp muta-
tion, which mimics Thr286 phosphorylation and stimulates binding to NR1 and 
NR2B, does not automatically induce translocation, but requires synaptic activity. 
One possible explanation is that although capable of binding to the NMDA receptor, 
it cannot bind to NR1 until α-actinin is removed from NR1 by the Ca2+/calmodulin 
elevation produced by synaptic activity (α-actinin and CaMKII compete for binding 
to the C0 region in the C-terminus of NR1) (143). Important evidence for the func-
tional relevance of the association of CaMKII with the NMDA receptor comes from 
studies in hippocampal slice cultures: overexpression of NR2B with mutations in the 
CaMKII binding site that abrogate the CaMKII interaction produces an strong inhibi-
tion of LTP (9)."

tory domain and is therefore constitutively ‘on’. Inhibition of PKMζ does not affect 
the early phase of LTP. Rather late phase LTP will not develop or will be reversed if 
inhibitor is applied after LTP is already established (111). Basal synaptic transmis-
sion is not affected. Importantly, a membrane- penetrable peptide inhibitor of PKMζ, 
ZIP, not only reverses LTP when applied in the slice preparation, but can irreversibly 
destroy a memory (place avoidance), when applied in vivo after learning (175, 199). 
Recent work shows that CaMKII activity is necessary for the synthesis of PKMζ 
(94). It is thus possible that CaMKII and PKMζ are both involved in the maintenance 
process. 
7.3 Late Phase LTP 
The early phase of LTP develops within seconds (101) and does not require protein 
synthesis. However, late-phase LTP is inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitors. In 
some reports, the effects of a protein synthesis inhibitor take hours to develop (51), 
but others report strong effects within 30 min (204). The induction of LTP triggers 
an increase in protein synthesis. For instance, it is known that some forms of mRNA 
are translated locally in the dendrites and that local regulators of translation can 
themselves be controlled by NMDA receptor activation. These effects on protein 
synthesis can occur within minutes after LTP induction (218). 
The utilization of these proteins is affected by a process called synaptic tagging 
(53). After inducing LTP in one pathway, subsequent application of a protein synthe-
sis inhibitor does not prevent LTP induced in a second pathway recorded from the 
same neuron. LTP in this second pathway had a normal late phase, despite the pres-
ence of protein synthesis inhibitor, presumably because it was able to use the pro-
teins whose synthesis that was triggered by the first pathway. This ability of one 
pathway to enhance another has a limited lifetime; if the pathways were stimulated 
more than a few hours apart, there was no interaction. To explain these results, it was 
proposed that LTP induction produces a transient synapse-specific biochemical 
modification that functions as a tag to incorporate proteins whose synthesis is trig-
gered by a process that is not synapse-specific. 
LTP induction causes changes in the transcription of many genes and triggers 
new protein synthesis. The early, transient burst of protein synthesis in the post-
synaptic dendrite utilizes pre-existing mRNA transcribed earlier from what are 
known as intermediate-early genes (IEGs) (33). These genes encode proteins such as 
the transcription factors zif/268 (33), growth factors such as BDNF (26, 42, 176), 
and enzymes such as CaMKII (124). Another immediate early gene product, 
Arc/Arg3.1 interacts with dynamin and endophilin to regulate AMPA receptor endo-
cytosis (221). Experiments in which inhibitors of transcription were found to block 
late LTP and the findings that some IEGs are transcription factors have suggested a 
role for the nucleus in supplying something needed for late LTP. In support of this 
hypothesis, in mutant mice lacking the transcription factor CREB, LTP is nearly 
normal soon after induction but is reduced at late times (21). 
It was originally thought that transient elevation of cAMP could directly activate 
the late phase of LTP, perhaps by stimulating CREB, which is responsive to cAMP. 
However, it now appears that this process is not a purely biochemical process, but"

rather depends on presynaptic electrical activity induced by cAMP (which can lead 
to closure of K+ channels). In fact, the potentiation induced by elevating cAMP re-
quires NMDA receptor activity (147, 169). 
While cAMP may not be sufficient for late LTP, it is probably necessary. This 
scenario may explain why dopamine modulation is necessary for late LTP. D1 recep-
tors activate adenylate cyclase and thereby elevate cAMP levels. Experiments with 
dopamine antagonists (52) or knockout of D1 receptors (135) indicate that late LTP 
is blocked under these conditions. These findings raise the question of what causes 
the firing of the dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that provides 
dopamine to the hippocampus. It now seems likely that the hippocampus itself com-
putes the novelty of incoming information and that the resulting novelty signal 
stimulates the VTA. In this way, the transition to long-term information storage (late 
LTP) may be conditional upon the novelty of the incoming information (114). 
BDNF has a major role in late LTP (23) and a single nucleotide polymorphism 
that impairs BDNF secretion correlates with poor episodic memory (44). The peptide 
is secreted from the presynaptic cell during LTP induction (234), primarily as 
proBDNF (149), and is converted to BDNF through the action of plasmin, a protease 
that itself undergoes activity-dependent secretion and activation by tpA (173) and 
possibly MMP-9 (154). BDNF acts on presynaptic TrkB receptors to enhance the 
synaptic vesicle release process during high frequency stimulation (49, 219, 220). 
BDNF also appears to be released in response to activity from the postsynaptic cell 
(72, 99). The relative contributions of pre- and post-synaptic release have not been 
determined. 
The early phase of LTP that occurs during the first 30 min does not appear to re-
quire BDNF action, but later phases do (92, 229). Notably, interfering with TrkB 
function at 30 min after LTP induction produces a rapid decrease in potentiation, 
suggesting that BDNF action is required for a considerable time after induction to 
maintain LTP. Surprisingly, the synthesis of BDNF may be the only protein synthe-
sis that is required for late LTP as demonstrated by the ability of BDNF to restore 
late LTP in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor. This finding takes on special 
importance given the recent evidence on the role of test pulses in the transition from 
early LTP to late LTP. Specifically, if test pulses are stopped after induction and then 
resumed about an hour later, the system is sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitor 
applied at this late time (50). 
These findings can be understood in terms of the model shown in Fig.2. LTP induc-
tion creates a potentiated state that is stable in the absence of stimulation, but labile in 
the presence of even low frequency test pulses. Normally, a product of protein synthe-
sis, likely BDNF, helps to convert the labile state into a stable state through an activity-
dependent process. If, however, a protein synthesis inhibitor is applied, a second com-
peting reaction becomes the most likely, the phosphatase-dependent de-potentiation of 
the labile state (232). Thus any of the following actions will interfere with the devel-
opment of the stable state: 1) Raising the frequency of test pulses because this activity 
attacks the labile state by a phosphatase-dependent process. 2) Factors that prevent 
BDNF-dependent processes including: protein synthesis inhibition (91); failure to 
process proBDNF to BDNF (173); lack of the BDNF receptor, TrkB (229); and inter-
ference with the phospholipase C pathway gated by TrkB (59, 90)."

Fig. 2. Model for the BDNF-driven conversion of labile early LTP to stable late LTP. Induc-
tion of synaptic potentiation induces early LTP by increasing the amplitude of AMPA recep-
tor-mediated responses. Activity-dependent release of BDNF has no direct effect on this step, 
but does induce TrkB-phospholipase-C activity, which strongly favors the activity (test pulse)-
dependent transition to late LTP. In the absence of coordinated BDNF release, neuronal activ-
ity (test pulses) drives depotentiation, the first step down a distinct pathway to return to the 
basal state. 
8 Modulatory Effects on LTP: Metaplasticity 
Scores of substances affect the induction of LTP, giving the impression that synaptic 
modification may be an extremely complex process. However, many of these may 
not interfere with the biochemistry of synaptic modification itself, but rather act 
indirectly to affect postsynaptic depolarization. As such action will influence NMDA 
receptor currents, LTP will be secondarily affected. For instance, the inhibition that 
is also evoked by the stimulating electrode may be so strong that LTP cannot be 
induced. Thus, blocking inhibition can enhance LTP induction (226). GABA antago-
nists ease the induction of LTP by blocking the rapid GABA-A receptor iontropic 
current, which would otherwise reduce the depolarization that is necessary to relieve 
Mg2+ block of the NMDA receptor (41, 77). Activation of the slower metabotropic 
GABA-B receptors sustains the hyperpolarizing IPSP. On the other hand, there are 
some GABA-dependent processes that can lead to an enhancement of LTP induction. 
GABA can bind to presynaptic GABA-B autoreceptors on interneurons (39). Slow 
activation of these receptors inhibits GABA release, thereby facilitating the induction 
of LTP by subsequent glutamategic input. This ‘priming’ effect peaks at approxi-
mately 200 ms with the consequence that theta patterns of stimuli optimally produce 
LTP (37, 38). 
Other work shows that activation of MAP-kinase through the insulin receptor can 
enhance the BK K+ conductance in hippocampal neurons thereby reducing excitabil-"

ity (163). The resulting interference with synaptically induced depolarization may 
account for the reduction of LTP by insulin. Also of clear importance in LTP are 
tyrosine kinases, particular Src. Results indicate that a major role of Src and its up-
stream regulator, the tyrosine kinase Pyk2, is in the activity-dependent upregulation 
of the NMDA receptor itself (81, 121). 
9 Prospects 
There are many developing areas of research that will yield new insight into the 
mechanisms of LTP and memory. In the past, physiological studies have dealt almost 
exclusively with the study of populations of synapses, but techniques are now being 
developed to study individual synapses. Combined with imaging methods, it should 
be possible to watch synapses as they undergo LTP and to obtain insight into struc-
ture–function issues. 
Rapid progress is also being made in understanding the molecular composition of 
the synapse. Once a molecule is identified, it is possible to screen for other mole-
cules that bind to that molecule. A picture is emerging of the molecular complexes 
on both sides of the synapse. However, this effort is hindered by lack of direct struc-
tural information about the PSD. Refinements of EM methods using tomography 
offers hope in this regard. 
Ultimately, the testing of hypotheses regarding the molecular basis of memory 
requires the ability to assay memory itself. There is increased understanding that 
there are many forms of memory and that they may be mediated by different mecha-
nisms. New behavioral tests are being developed that allow particular forms of 
memory to be assessed. The ability of genetic methods to produce defined molecular 
changes at precise times and precise locations in living animals will make it possible 
to test whether particular forms of memory rely on particular molecules. 
We are who we are largely because of our accumulated experience stored in 
memory. As more is learned about LTP, it will become possible to manipulate mem-
ory. It would clearly be undesirable to wipe our memory clear. But as we come to 
understand the biochemical basis of memory, it may become possible to affect spe-
cific memories. This may help in the treatment of unwanted memories, such as those 
involved in posttraumatic stress disorders. On the other hand, an understanding of 
memory and the process of forgetting is likely to yield drugs that will help in the 
treatment of memory disorders. The implications for understanding the molecular 
basis of memory are vast and probably largely unanticipated.

Homeostatic Synaptic Plasticity

Abstract. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity mechanisms provide a means for neurons and cir-
cuits to maintain stable function in the face of perturbations such as developmental or activity-
dependent changes in synapse number or strength. These forms of plasticity use negative 
feedback signaling to adjust synaptic properties to keep activity close to some internal set 
point value. Recent work suggests that there are likely multiple forms of synaptic homeostasis, 
mediated by distinct signaling pathways and with distinct expression mechanisms. Both exci-
tatory and inhibitory synapses are subject to homeostatic regulation, and the form of plasticity 
present at a particular synapse likely depends on its function within a neuronal circuit. 
1 Introduction 
“Somehow the unstable stuff of which we are composed has learned the trick of 
maintaining stability.” 
- Walter Cannon, The Wisdom of the Body, 1932 
 
Nervous systems are faced with a fundamental problem: how to allow plastic 
mechanisms to shape their output and function, without compromising the stability 
and integrity of the underlying circuits that drive behavior. Many of the plastic 
changes that underlie developmental and learning-related adaptations are thought to 
require synapse-specific changes in synaptic strengths, yet these processes exert a 
powerful destabilizing influence on network function (1, 56). “Hebbian” (after Don-
ald Hebb) forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and 
long-term depression (LTD), strengthen synaptic inputs that are effective at depolar-
izing the postsynaptic neuron, and weaken inputs whose firing is not correlated with 
the postsynaptic neuron. Such correlation-based mechanisms are problematic: by 
analogy to unconstrained capitalism, the rich continually get richer, and the poor get 
poorer. For example, in the synaptic arena this happens because strong synapses that 
are effective at depolarizing the postsynaptic neuron will continue to be strength-
ened, and will thus become better able to depolarize the postsynaptic neuron, initiat-
ing an unconstrained positive feedback cycle.

slower potentiation of NMDA currents, and this delayed NMDA-potentiation again 
acts to restore the AMPA-to-NMDA ratio (93).  
The mechanisms underlying homeostatic plasticity of NMDA currents are poorly 
understood (64). Activity-dependent alternative splicing of NMDAR controls export 
of receptors from the endoplasmic reticulum, and can exert one level of control over 
the surface expression of NMDA receptor (57). A second level of control has been 
demonstrated in spinal neurons (which normally have very low levels of synaptic 
NMDAR), where synaptic activity has been shown to inhibit the surface redistribu-
tion of NMDAR into synaptic sites (72). Whether this mechanism also operates at 
cortical and hippocampal synapses is not known. The slower NMDA potentiation 
during LTP at neocortical synapses depends upon AMPA potentiation and can be 
blocked by manipulations that prevent insertion of AMPAR, suggesting that accumu-
lating more AMPA receptors at synaptic sites eventually leads to the accumulation of 
more NMDA receptors (93), possibly through protein-protein interactions within the 
postsynaptic density.

ity of excitatory (green) and inhibitory (red) synapses cooperate to adjust neuronal activity. 
When activity falls too low, excitation is increased and inhibition is decreased, and vice versa. 
 
At many synapses information is carried both by AMPA and NMDA currents. 
Functionally, maintaining a relatively constant ratio of AMPA to NMDA current 
may ensure that plasticity mechanisms like LTP and synaptic scaling can change

synaptic strength without fundamentally altering the information content of synaptic 
transmission. On the other hand, increasing or decreasing NMDA current may 
strongly affect NMDAR-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity. Given that high 
levels of calcium influx through NMDAR tend to induce LTP, while lower levels 
tend to induce LTD, the likelihood of inducing potentiation or depression by any 
given pattern of pre and postsynaptic co-activation will be altered by scaling NMDA 
currents up or down. If neurons are inactive and scale up synaptic strengths, this 
should promote LTP and the expense of LTD, and vice-versa. Scaling of NMDA 
currents may thus generate the kind of “sliding plasticity threshold” that has been 
postulated to operate in sensory cortex, and can contribute to the generation of stabil-
ity within plastic neuronal networks (4). 
8 Homeostatic Plasticity of Inhibitory Synapses  
Homeostatic plasticity at excitatory synapses is probably not sufficient to maintain 
network stability in many central networks. For example, cortical networks have 
extensive positive feedback connections between excitatory pyramidal neurons both 
within and between cortical layers, which are kept in check by feedback and feed-
forward inhibition mediated by several types of inhibitory interneurons. Small 
changes in the balance between excitation and inhibition in such networks can dis-
rupt cortical function (10, 38, 60) and can affect the induction of Hebbian forms of 
experience-dependent plasticity (27, 29, 34, 35). This suggests that excitation and 
inhibition must be delicately balanced to keep CNS networks functional, In more 
mature networks, recent work has established that several kinds of plasticity at syn-
apses onto and from GABAergic interneurons are present in the CNS, and like plas-
ticity at excitatory synapses can provide both stabilizing and destabilizing influences 
on network function (21, 39, 40, 44, 61). 
Reduced visual experience has long been known to induce compensatory changes 
in inhibition within primary visual cortex (26). A similar phenomenon has been 
found in dissociated cortical and hippocampal networks, where activity-blockade 
reversibly decreases GABA immunoreactivity (52, 53, 73), and reduces the amount 
of functional inhibition received by pyramidal neurons (73). Like homeostatic plas-
ticity at excitatory synapses inhibition is modified through changes in quantal ampli-
tude and receptor clustering. However, a major locus of expression is also a dramatic 
reduction in the number of functional inhibitory synapses (33), at a time in vitro 
when there are no changes in excitatory synapse number (97); conversely, inhibitory 
synapse number does not change in older cultures (25) (at a time when excitatory 
synapse number does (97)). Excitatory and inhibition synapses onto cultured cortical 
pyramidal neurons are therefore regulated in opposite directions, and utilize a differ-
ent subset of expression mechanisms. Changes in inhibition are an important compo-
nent of firing rate homeostasis within these cultured networks (45, 74), and these 
studies strongly suggest that the balance between excitation and inhibition is not a 
fixed quantity, but can be continually adjusted by ongoing activity.  
 
GABAergic interneurons are very diverse in morphology and connectivity, and 
play distinct roles within cortical and hippocampal microcircuits. This raises the"

important question of whether all inhibitory synapse types are regulated the same by 
homeostatic mechanisms, or whether functionally distinct classes of interneuron 
respond differently to long-lasting changes in activity. This question has recently 
been addressed within the cortical microcircuitry of layer 4, where visual deprivation 
during early postnatal development was found to induce compensatory changes in 
network excitability through reciprocal changes in total excitation and inhibition 
(45). These effects look very similar to those seen in dissociated cortical networks 
(74). In slices from deprived and control cortex it was possible to independently 
evaluate changes at two distinct types of inhibitory synapse onto layer 4 star pyrami-
dal neurons, fast-spiking (FS) basket cells and regular-spiking non-pyramidal 
(RSNP) neurons. FS synapses onto star pyramidal neurons behaved as expected from 
changes in total inhibition (i.e., reduced visual drive reduced the strength of these 
connections). However, RSNP synapses actually underwent an increase in synaptic 
strength following visual deprivation. This was accompanied by a reduction in con-
nection probability between RSNP and star pyramidal neurons, so that the net effect 
at this synapse is that a given star pyramid is contacted by only half as many RSNP 
neurons, but each unitary connection is twice as strong (45). While the functional 
effects of this synaptic remodeling are not clear, this study illustrates the point that 
the rules for homeostatic plasticity within real microcircuits are likely to be quite 
complicated.  
 
Studies on both in vivo and in vitro cortical networks show that homeostatic 
synaptic plasticity rules function to independently adjust excitatory and inhibitory 
feedback loops, in a manner predicted to preserve the level of network activity in the 
face of changes in drive to the network (45, 74). When activity falls too low (be-
cause, for example, sensory drive is reduced), excitation between pyramidal neurons 
is boosted, and feedback inhibition is reduced, which should cooperate to raise the 
firing rates of pyramidal neurons. Conversely, when activity is too high, excitation 
between pyramids is reduced (85), while inhibition is increased (Hurvitz and Tur-
rigiano, unpublished observations), so that the activity of pyramidal neurons is re-
duced (74, 85). Homeostatic regulation of network activity in recurrent cortical cir-
cuits thus appears to be “pyramidal neuron-centric”, operating through a coordinated 
set of changes that selectively adjust synaptic strengths to drive pyramidal neuron 
activity toward some set point range.  
 
One important signaling pathway in the homeostatic regulation of inhibitory 
synapses is through the activity-dependent release of BDNF (25, 73, 74, 79). Since 
BDNF is produced and released by pyramidal neurons, this suggests that inhibitory 
synapses onto pyramidal neurons should be regulated as a function of pyramidal 
neuron, rather than interneuron, activity. Interestingly, although hyperpolarization of 
individual pyramidal neurons is capable of inducing some forms of excitatory synap-
tic homeostasis (8), hyperpolarization of neither individual pyramidal neurons nor 
individual interneurons was capable of inducing homeostatic changes in inhibition. 
Only global changes in network activity accomplished this, suggesting that network 
activity is monitored through extracellular BDNF levels, which then act to homeo-
statically adjust inhibitory synapses.  
 
BDNF plays an important role in the maturation of inhibitory circuits in vivo and 
in vitro. In cortical cultures a chronic increase in BDNF levels has been shown to"

potentiate excitatory synapses onto inhibitory interneurons, as well as inhibitory 
synapses onto pyramidal neurons. These two effects act synergistically to strengthen 
feedback inhibition onto pyramidal neurons, and thus cooperate to shift the balance 
between excitation and inhibition within these cultured networks toward inhibition. 
This suggests that when pyramidal neuron activity rises too high the resulting in-
creased release of BDNF recruits additional inhibition, which then dampens pyrami-
dal neuron activity again. Somewhat at odds with this idea that BDNF acts as a net-
work-wide homeostatic regulator of circuit activity is the demonstration that BDNF 
can acutely potentiate excitatory synapses onto hippocampal and cortical neurons 
under some conditions (see section on excitatory synaptic scaling above). BDNF 
plays many roles in synaptic function, and so understanding its specific role in ho-
meostatic plasticity will require a better understanding of the different effects of 
acute and chronic changes in BDNF signaling, as well as local versus global release 
and action of this neurotrophin. The role of other signaling pathways in inhibitory 
homeostatic plasticity has not as yet been investigated.  
9 Homeostatic synaptic plasticity in vivo 
Major challenges for the field now include understanding when and why different 
forms of homeostatic plasticity are present in real neuronal networks, and how these 
homeostatic mechanisms interact with Hebbian forms of plasticity to generate flexi-
ble yet stable microcircuits. When one measures a change in synaptic properties, it is 
very difficult to determine which plasticity mechanism gave rise to that change. 
Progress in assigning cellular mechanisms to experience-dependent changes in cir-
cuit properties will require that we know the full range of plasticity mechanisms 
present within a given microcircuit, as well as possess a much deeper mechanistic 
understanding of how each change is produced. Only when we can selectively inter-
fere with particular forms of Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity during experience-
Microcircuits in intact brains are generally quite complex. Most are composed of 
many different neuron types, and have extensive feedback and feedforward connec-
tions that can be excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory. It is now clear, from a number 
of studies. that homeostatic plasticity is present in the central nervous system in vivo, 
and plays important roles in shaping connectivity during development and in re-
sponse to experience (17, 22, 23, 37, 45, 76). How homeostatic plasticity rules work 
within such complex networks is far from understood, but several points are becom-
ing clear. First, like many other forms of plasticity, homeostatic synaptic plasticity is 
strongly developmentally regulated, and can be turned on and off in different cell 
types at different times in development (17, 22, 44). Second, different synapse 
“types” respond differently to the same activity-manipulation, indicating that homeo-
static plasticity rules for a given synapse type depend on the identity of both the 
presynaptic and the postsynaptic neuron (45). For example, excitatory synapse onto 
interneurons are regulated differently than excitatory synapses onto pyramidal neu-
rons within neocortical layer 4 of rodent visual cortex; additionally, different classes 
of inhibitory synapse respond differently to visual deprivation (44)."

1 Introduction 
The remodeling of synapses is a fundamental mechanism for information storage and 
processing in the brain. During brain development, and in response to learning-
related activity, synapses undergo remarkable structural changes, including growth, 
shrinkage, and elimination. Such structural plasticity provides a physical basis for 
enduring changes in neural circuits that are mediated by alterations in the molecular 
composition of the synapse. Indeed, stabilization or removal of neurotransmitter 
receptors, scaffold proteins, and signaling molecules from the synapse has been 
proposed to account for long-term changes in synaptic strength. Patterns of molecu-
lar changes in large sets of synaptic proteins, which ultimately encode the history of 
activity at the synapse, represent a level of complexity that we are only now begin-
ning to understand. 
Long-lasting changes in the molecular content of synapses arise by two general 
mechanisms: the incorporation of new proteins and the selective removal of existing 
synaptic proteins. For much of the past two decades, the prevailing model for endur-
ing changes in synapse function and structure has been stimulus-dependent gene 
expression and protein synthesis. Indeed, substantial evidence indicates that tran-
scriptional events are critical for long-term activity-dependent plasticity (135, 184). 
In addition, local translation of mRNAs is thought to orchestrate long-lasting forms 
of learning-related synaptic plasticity (269). On the other hand, considerably less 
attention has been given to the contribution of protein turnover to long-term struc-
tural and functional changes at synapses. 
What controls the turnover and replacement of synaptic proteins? For most cel-
lular proteins, the major pathway of degradation occurs by ubiquitin conjugation and 
subsequent targeting of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins to the proteasome. Here we 
will discuss the role of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) in the structural and

Ubiquitin and Protein Degradation in Synapse Function

Fig. 1. Overview of the UPS.  
Ubiquitin (Ub) monomers are activated in an ATP-dependent reaction by the Ub-activating 
enzyme (E1) and subsequently transferred to a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2). Ub ligases (E3) 
facilitate the transfer of Ub to normal or abnormal target proteins. The covalent transfer of Ub 
monomers to lysine (K) acceptor residues of the previously attached Ub results in the forma-
tion of a poly-Ub chain. Poly-Ub chains linked through lysine 48 (K48) target proteins for 
degradation at the 26S proteasome. The residual poly-Ub chains are recycled into Ub mono-
mers by deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes. DUBs can also trim or remove ubiquitin from 
ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Monoubiquitination and K63-linked polyubiquitination direct 
non-proteasomal functions including endocytosis, protein trafficking, DNA repair, and tran-
scription. Proteins possessing ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) act as ubiquitin receptors. 
Recognition of ubiquitin moieties signals key regulatory events in biological pathways. Note 
that other lysine linkages on Ub can occur but are not indicated."

The identification of HECT domain ubiquitin ligases ensued from studies of tu-
mors arising from infection by the human papilloma virus. During infection, the 
ubiquitin ligase E6-AP, also known as Ube3a (Fig. 2, Table 1), complexes with the 
E6 viral protein, causing the degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor and other 
pathological substrates (247). Sequence alignment revealed conservation between the  
 
Fig. 2. E3 ligase subtype structure.  
Two principal classes of E3 ligases. (A) Two examples of HECT (homologous to E6-AP  
carboxyl terminus) domain E3 ligases are shown: Ube3a/E6-AP and NEDD4. Ube3a/E6-AP 
contains an E6 substrate-binding domain and a C-terminal HECT domain. NEDD4 has an N-
terminal C2 domain and several WW domains conferring cellular localization and substrate 
recognition, and a C-terminal HECT domain. In both cases, ubiquitin moities are covalently 
coupled to the HECT domain prior to being transferred to substrate lysine residues. (B) RING 
domain E3 ligase. Two examples of unit RING E3 ligases are shown. Parkin has an N-terminal 
UBL domain and two RING-binding domains separated by an IBR (in between RING) domain. 
Mdm2 has a single C-terminal RING domain along with an N-terminal p53-binding domain, a 
zinc finger (ZF) domain, a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a nuclear exclusion signal (NES), 
and a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS). RING domains recognize substrates and, by position-
ing substrates near cognate E2s, mediate the transfer of Ub from E2 enzymes to target proteins. 
(C) SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) is a member of a multisubunit RING E3 ligase class where target 
proteins are recognized through members of the F-box family of proteins which are linked to 
cullin scaffolds by a Skp1 adaptor. A key feature of the cullin-RING E3 ligases is that each cullin 
can assemble with any number of substrate receptors to form ubiquitin ligase complexes contain-
ing a common structural core but different substrate specificities."

Another family of RING ubiquitin ligases is the cullin-RING ligases (82, 256). 
Cullins are scaffold proteins with a distinct globular C-terminal domain (cullin ho-
mology domain) and a series of N-terminal repeats of a five-helix bundle (cullin 
repeats) (316). In mammals, cullin-RING ligases are composed of one of seven 
known cullin proteins (CUL1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 7) and a catalytic RING protein. 
The core complex is linked to specific targets by various adaptor proteins, most 
notably F-box proteins. A well-studied group of cullin-RING ligases is the SCF 
family. The SCF ubiquitin ligases are multisubunit E3 ligases consisting of a 
CUL1/RING core and SKP1 and F-box proteins that confer substrate specificity 
(Fig. 2). The combination of the several identified classes of E3 ligases along with 
numerous possible subunit combinations, such as the cullin proteins and diverse F-
box proteins, affords a capacity to recognize a wide array of target proteins for ubiq-
uitination. 
2.2 The 26S Proteasome 
 
C-terminus of E6-AP, including the critical catalytic cysteine, and several seemingly 
unrelated proteins (123), defining the HECT class of E3 ligases. Most non-HECT 
domain E3 enzymes possess a RING domain (81, 132, 173, 178) (Fig. 2). The RING 
class of E3 enzymes is further subdivided into the plant homeobox domain/leukemia-
associated protein and U-box families, both characterized by small modifications in 
their RING domains. It is interesting to note that ubiquitin fusion degradation 2, the 
first identified U-box protein, is also classified as an E4 enzyme (154). E4 enzymes 
are a novel class of proteins that coordinate with E3 ligases and facilitate ubiquitin 
chain elongation.  
The 26S proteasome is a 2.5 MDa protein machine made up of two copies of at least 
32 different subunits that are highly conserved among eukaryotes (93). The protea-
some is an abundant complex making up approximately 1% of total cellular protein 
(168). The 26S proteasome has been localized to nearly every subcellular compart-
ment including the nucleus, nucleolus, and cytoplasm (302). The 26S proteasome 
itself is composed of two stable, multimeric complexes, the catalytic 20S particle and 
the 19S regulatory complex (14, 289) (Fig. 1). The 20S component is composed of 
seven α and seven β subunits that assemble to form two α and two β heptameric 
rings. The rings are stacked to form a cylinder with two β rings bordered on each 
side by an α ring (Fig. 1) (14, 208). In eukaryotes, the two β heptameric rings con-
tain multiple proteolytic sites. There are at least two trypsin-like, two chymotrypsin-
like, and two caspase-like proteolytic regions that act cooperatively to allow the 
proteasome to cleave target proteins at distinct peptide linkages. The base of the 19S 
component is composed of eight subunits and a ring of six AAA family ATPases that 
gate the lumen of the proteasome and regulate the energy-dependent unfolding of 
target proteins (30, 94, 155, 206). Within the 19S complex, the S5a subunit (known 
as Rpn10 or Pus1 in budding yeast and fission yeast, respectively), Rad23, and one 
of the ATPases have been shown to interact with polyubiquitin chains and ubiquitin-
like protein domains (74, 75, 161, 283, 310), thereby participating in the targeting of 
polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome."

2.3 Deubiquitinating Enzymes 
Just as the addition of ubiquitin is carried out by ubiquitin ligases, there are more than 
70 deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in two major classes, both of which cleave the 
G76 isopeptide bond of ubiquitin (258). The ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH) 
process ubiquitinated precursor molecules into their mature forms, as well as interact 
with monoubiquitinated proteins (212, 295), and recycle ubiquitin from polyubiquiti-
nated proteins at the proteasome to maintain a free ubiquitin pool (Fig. 1, Table 1) (4, 
26, 74, 102, 170). Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USP) have conserved 350-amino acid 
core catalytic domains that disassemble polyubiquitinated protein chains (270). 
2.4 Degradative Pathway of Ubiquitinated Substrates  
2.4.1.Ubiquitin Recognition  
Target proteins typically contain at least four K48-linked ubiquitin molecules that are 
able to bind the proteasome via S5a/Rpn10 (274), the major proteasome subunit 
known to bind ubiquitin chains (see Section 2.2). Rpn10 contains a ubiquitin-binding 
site within its C-terminus in a hydrophobic region containing a LALAL motif (86). 
The carboxy termini of Rpn10 homologs (p54 from Drosophila and mammalian S5a) 
contain two such hydrophobic repeats within their ubiquitin-interacting motifs 
(UIM), and both have been shown to bind ubiquitin (103, 310). While 
Rpn10/p54/S5a is the primary proteasome subunit with an affinity for polyubiquitin 
chains, Rad23 can be co-precipitated with substrates that contain short multiubiquitin 
chains and contain a ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA) at the carboxy terminus of 
the protein that can directly interact with ubiquitin (18, 114). Rad23 and its human 
counterparts hHR23a and hHR23b bind to proteasomes via an amino terminal ubiq-
uitin-like (UBL) domain which shares homology with ubiquitin (112, 246). While 
these proteins have been shown to aid in ubiquitin recognition, it is likely that more 
proteins on the proteasome are involved in this process. 
2.4.2 Substrate Binding  
2.4.3 Unfolding and Translocation  
Proteolysis of proteins by the proteasome is ATP-dependent (62, 108, 113). ATP 
hydrolysis cycles the regulatory 19S subunit between high- and low-affinity states, 
alternately binding and releasing substrates. The subsequent conformational changes 
 
Rpn1 and Rpn2 comprise the proteasome base along with the six AAA ATPases. 
Rpn1 and Rpn2 contain multiple leucine-rich repeats, regions that promote protein–
protein interactions with substrates (182). In order for substrate binding to occur, the 
target protein must be properly positioned to be unfolded by the base and translo-
cated into the proteasome core. The distal positioning of the proteasome lid likely 
ensures that ubiquitin chains conjugated to substrates do not occlude access of the 
target protein to the channel. The proteasome base can also bind to non-
ubiquitinated, unfolded substrates and promote their folding (30, 268)."

associated with ATPase activity lead to gating of the proteolytic channel, substrate 
unfolding, and threading of the linearized substrate through the channel into the 
catalytic lumen of the 20S core particle.  
Protein unfolding is required for proteolysis because the estimated inner diame-
ter of the 20S subunit lumen is too narrow for proteins to enter in their native state. 
ATP hydrolysis alters 19S subunit affinities for substrate proteins, thus stabilizing 
them in an unfolded state. The location of the proteasome base points to its role in 
promoting substrate unfolding. The base, with its six ATPases, covers the entry ports 
into the 20S core particle. The archaea proteasome base homolog, PAN, unfolds 
proteins before translocation to the 20S subunit (205, 318). Similar to the 19S regula-
tory particle, the 20S subunit also binds unfolded proteins in an ATP-dependent 
manner, releasing them in vitro (30, 268). Thus, substrates are translocated from one 
domain within the proteasome (19S) to another (20S) in an ATP-dependent manner. 
2.4.4 Gating  
2.4.5 Proteolysis  
Typically, the proteasome cleaves protein substrates into peptides from 3 to 23 
amino acids in length (149, 213). This process is restrictive such that a protein is 
hydrolyzed within the proteasome to its final products before the next substrate en-
ters, leading to a pattern of generated peptides from a specific substrate that is stable 
over time (148, 210). The resulting peptide products are likely rapidly hydrolyzed by 
downstream proteases and aminopeptidases.  
The 20S core particle has the ability to cleave peptide bonds after any amino 
acid, but each of the three active site-containing β-subunits preferentially cleaves 
after specific amino acids. The β1-subunit has been shown to cleave after acidic or 
small hydrophobic amino acids, β2 cleaves after small hydrophobic or basic amino 
acids, while β5 hydrolyzes the peptide bond after hydrophobic residues (64). Inter-
estingly, the 20S core particle and the proteasome holoenzyme can generate different 
The N-termini of α-subunits in the α-rings obstruct access to the proteolytic chamber 
of the 20S core particle (see Fig. 1), indicating that the proteasome channel is gated 
(99, 100). The N-terminus of α3 is distinct from the other α-subunits in that it points 
directly across the α-ring surface toward the center of the lumen contacting every 
other α-subunit. For substrates to enter and exit the proteolytic core, the blocking N-
terminal residues of these α-subunits must be altered. The formation of the well-
defined closed configuration of the gate requires dramatic changes in the structure of 
the core particle. A possible mechanism for gating activation is the attachment of the 
19S regulatory particle to the core particle. Attachment of the 19S regulatory particle 
to the α-ring forms competing interactions with tyrosine, aspartate, or arginine resi-
dues in the α-subunits themselves. This realignment then allows the passage of un-
folded substrates into the core particle. It has been shown that the Rpt2-α3 (one of 
the six AAA ATPases and one of the 19S α-subunits, respectively) pairing is in-
volved in the gating of the channel into the core particle. However, it is possible that 
gating is controlled by more than one Rpt-α interaction (60, 85, 99, 155, 237)."

patterns of cleavage products from the same target protein (76, 149). This implies 
that the 19S regulatory particle can affect the behavior of the core particle. 
2.4.6 Deubiquitination  
Free ubiquitin is also a product of the proteasome. After proteolysis, ubiquitin, or 
ubiquitin attached to residual peptide chains, is released from the proteasome and 
recycled back into the ubiquitin pathway (Fig. 1, Table 1) (116, 270). In order to 
dismantle polyubiquitin chains, a deubiquitinating enzyme must work in conjunction 
with the 19S regulatory particle to replenish the monoubiquitin pool. The 19S regula-
tory particle from various sources has been shown to possess ubiquitin hydrolase 
activity leading to editing or complete removal of ubiquitin from protein substrates 
(78, 160, 162, 167). The 19S regulatory particle p37a is thought to be responsible for 
this deubiquitinating activity in Drosophila. Doa4 has been suggested as the deubiq-
uitinating subunit of the 19S regulatory particle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (218), 
and the 19S lid subunit Rpn11/POH1 has been shown to have deubiquitinating activ-
ity in mammals (228). The deubiquitinating enzyme USP14 (the mammalian  
homolog to yeast Ubp6p) has also been shown to associate with mammalian protea-
somes (26). 
2.5 Protein Domains That Bind or Mimic Ubiquitin 
Various adaptor proteins that regulate protein degradation and trafficking possess 
protein domains that bind or mimic ubiquitin (110, 146). These domains include 
ubiquitin-associated (UBA), ubiquitin-like (UBL), and ubiquitin E2-variant (UEV) 
domains, as well as ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM), and CUE domains. The 
structure of UPS adaptor proteins points to the general function of these domains. 
For example, the DNA repair protein Rad23 in yeast contains two UBA domains and 
an N-terminal UBL domain (232). This protein arrangement indicates that Rad23 has 
the ability to bind polyubiquitinated proteins via its UBA domain while simultane-
ously docking with the proteasome through its UBL domain.  
 
A number of proteins associated with the endocytic pathway have UIM domains 
including Eps15, Eps15R, epsins, and Hrs (151, 229, 233, 253). Eps15 and Hrs form 
protein complexes that mediate sorting of ubiquitinated membrane cargo in the lu-
men of endocytic vesicles that are destined for lysosomal degradation. The Hrs-UIM 
has recently been shown to simultaneously bind two ubiquitin molecules (111). This 
double ubiquitin-interacting motif (DUIM)-binding ability is thought to make Hrs-
ubiquitin interaction more efficient, assisting in endosomal sorting. As another ex-
ample, Tsg101 (the mammalian homolog to yeast Vps23), a component of the 
ESCRT-I complex, contains a UEV domain that participates in sorting ubiquitinated 
cargo in late endocytic compartments (further discussed in the next section). On the 
other hand, CUE domains are structurally related to UBA domains. The ubiquitin-
binding CUE domain of the yeast protein Vps9 and Vps9 domain-containing proteins 
in mammals have conserved functions in intracellular receptor trafficking through 
the endocytic pathway (40). These proteins are discussed in further detail in the 
following sections."

2.6 Ubiquitination in the Endocytic Pathway 
In all eukaryotic cells, a highly organized network of endosomes facilitates protein 
trafficking between the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and the plasma membrane. 
Ubiquitination and ubiquitin adaptor proteins regulate cargo endocytosis from the 
plasma membrane and subsequent sorting in the endocytic pathway (37, 132, 151, 
192, 229, 233, 253, 261, 298). Often, the addition of ubiquitin itself can trigger sur-
face protein internalization of a variety of transmembrane proteins, including ion 
channels, G protein-coupled receptors, and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (109, 
195, 252, 264). 
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an extensively studied model of 
cell signaling and receptor internalization through the endocytic pathway. EGFRs are 
RTKs involved in controlling the proliferation, differentiation, migration, adhesion, 
and survival of numerous mammalian cell types including neurons. EGF binding 
induces the dimerization of EGFRs which form docking sites for Src-homology-2 
(SH2) domain effector proteins (Fig. 3). Upon ligand binding, the internalization of 
EGFRs is mediated by the SH2 domain-containing E3 RING ubiquitin ligase Cbl. At 
the cell surface, activated, dimerized EGFRs enter clathrin-coated pits where the 
multiubiquitinated receptor-Cbl complex associates with Cbl-interacting protein of 
85 kDa (CIN85) and endophilins (Fig. 3). At this point, EGFRs autophosphorylate 
and induce the monoubiquitination of EGFR-pathway substrate-15 (Eps15) and 
epsin, the latter of which interacts with the plasma membrane. As indicated in the 
previous section, Eps15 and epsin contain UIMs. These domains promote interac-
tions between EGFRs and Eps15/epsin via ubiquitin binding. Interestingly, 
monoubiquitinated epsin loses its ability to interact with AP2 and clathrin indicating 
that ubiquitination may promote the release of internalized EGFRs from clathrin 
adaptor proteins (187). 
On early endosomes, the hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase 
substrate (Hrs) binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) where it as-
sembles in a ternary complex with signal transduction adaptor molecule (STAM) and 
Eps15 (Fig. 3) (11). Once internalized into early endosomes, EGFRs are either  
recycled back to the cell surface or sorted to multivesicular endosomes 
(MVE)/multivesicular bodies (MVB) where Hrs interacts with Tsg101 (Fig. 3), a 
component of the ESCRT-I complex. The mammalian ESCRT-I complex, consisting 
of Tsg101, Vps28, and one of four isotypes of Vps37(A-D), binds to ubiquitin 
through the N-terminal UEV domain of Tsg101 increasing the efficiency of ubiquiti-
nated cargo sorting (19). 
The next step in MVE/MVB sorting includes the association of ESCRT-II with 
vesicular cargo (Fig. 3). ESCRT-II consists of Vps22, Vps25, and Vps36. The N-
terminus of Vps36 has been termed a GLUE (GRAM-like ubiquitin binding in EAP45) 
domain which binds ubiquitin in vitro (257). In yeast, ESCRT-II binds ESCRT-I with 
high affinity through an interaction with the Vps36 GLUE domain and the Vps28 
subunit of ESCRT-I (92). In yeast and Drosophila, deletion of ESCRT-II components 
results in missorting of vacuolar hydrolases and surface accumulation of Notch, respec-
tively (273). In mammalian cells, siRNA-mediated depletion of ESCRT-II inhibits the 
downregulation of specific cell surface receptors (163)."

Fig. 3. Ubiquitin in receptor trafficking.  
The EGF receptor is a model for ubiquitin-dependent receptor trafficking. Upon binding 
ligand, EGFRs dimerize and autophosphorylate their tyrosine residues. Activated EGFRs then 
enter clathrin-coated pits where the phosphorylated receptors recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase 
Cbl, which multiubiquitinates the EGFR leading to an association with the Cbl-interacting 
protein of 85 kDa (CIN85) and endophilins. The clathrin adaptors epsin and Eps15 form a 
complex and bind to monoubiquitinated EGFRs through their ubiquitin-interacting motifs 
(UIMs). Within early endosomes, Hrs binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) 
forming a multiprotein complex with signal transduction adaptor molecule (STAM) and Eps15 
which in turn interacts with EGFRs. Hrs and STAM bind ubiquitin directly through their UIM 
domains, and Hrs undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation after receptor tyrosine kinase activation. 
In early endosomes, EGFRs can be either recycled back to the cell surface or directed to the 
multivesicular endosome/multivesicular body (MVE/MVB) for degradation. At the 
MVE/MVB, Hrs binds to Tsg101, a UIM-containing component of the ESCRT-I complex. 
This interaction shuttles endocytosed EGFRs to ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III complexes and 
then into the intralumenal vesicles of MVEs/MVBs. Following invagination into 
MVEs/MVBs, EGFRs are then degraded by delivery to the lysosome."

3 The Ubiquitin–Proteasome System in Synapse Development 
3.1 Axon Growth, Steering, and Pruning 
The yeast ESCRT-III complex consists of Vps2, Vps24, Snf7, and Vps20 which 
form two subcomplexes (Fig. 3) (9). Studies have suggested that ESCRT-III proteins 
exist in a stable, monomeric closed form where the C-terminal region blocks het-
erodimerization with the cores of other ESCRT-III subunits until an activation signal 
removes it (176, 311). The activated, open-form subunits are then thought to assem-
ble into ESCRT-III lattices on the endosomal membrane (9, 287). Although yet un-
proven, it is proposed that the ESCRT-III lattices spatially restrict membrane curva-
ture-inducing factors to initiate budding toward the lumen. ESCRT-III subunit 
activation triggers interactions with components of the MVB pathway such as the 
Vps25 subunit of ESCRT-II (Fig. 3) (10, 272) and PtdIns(3,5)P2 (294). In yeast, 
deletion of ESCRT-III subunits results in endocytic cargo accumulation, and deple-
tion of the ESCRT-III subunit Vps24 in mammalian cells inhibits the degradation of 
EGFRs (12, 117). As a final step, the protein Vps4 is required for proper disassembly 
of ESCRT components and sorting of cargo to MVBs (Fig. 3). The N-terminus of 
Vps4 has been shown to interact with C-terminal regions of ESCRT-III proteins (9, 
176). In yeast, all ESCRT complexes remain tightly associated with membranes in 
the absence of Vps4 (9, 209), and it has been shown in mammalian cells that Vps4 
function is required to disassemble clathrin coats on endocytotic vesicles (239). 
While the major components of the MVB pathway have largely been identified, 
several questions remain. What is the molecular organization of the ESCRT-III lat-
tice, what is its function, and how is it disassembled? Do the multiple mammalian 
ESCRT subunits have distinct roles in the endocytic pathway or are they redundant? 
How does cargo ubiquitination and endosomal sorting regulate membrane composi-
tion in highly compartmentalized cells such as neurons? 
Ubiquitin-dependent protein trafficking has been implicated in early axonal growth 
cone migration. Two of the better characterized proteins in axon guidance are the 
roundabout (Robo) and DCC/Frazzled (Fra) receptors that respond to extracellular 
migration signals. DCC/FRA is an attractant receptor that responds to the secreted 
protein Netrin-1, while the repellent receptor Robo responds to secreted Slit protein 
ligand (32, 61). Growth cone surface expression of either DCC/FRA or Robo is in-
volved in proper steering of the growth cone. During early growth cone development, 
Robo expression is controlled by an association with Commisureless (Comm), prevent-
ing Robo cell surface expression by facilitating Robo targeting to the lysosome for 
degradation (89, 140). At this stage, the absence of Robo ensures that the growth cone 
will continue migrating toward the midline. The HECT domain E3 ligase Nedd4 rec-
ognizes Comm and the subsequent ubiquitination of Comm/Robo regulates its delivery 
to lysosomes for degradation (Table 1) (203). Once the growth cone has crossed the 
midline, transcriptional regulation mechanisms diminish Comm expression leading to 
Robo expression on the surface of the growth cone (140). In contrast to Robo, 
DCC/FRA expression on the surface of the growth cone leads to steering toward the 
midline. DCC/FRA is polyubiquitinated by the RING domain E3 ligase Siah and"

Ubiquitin and Protein Degradation in Synapse Function

Interestingly, as Robo signaling directs the growth cone toward its synaptic target, 
formation of the synapse requires an elimination of Comm surface expression (303). 
Without Comm removal, synaptogenesis fails. Comm localizes to intracellular vesicles 
in muscle and endocytosis of Comm requires binding to dNedd4 via its two PY motifs 
and accompanying ubiquitination of Comm (125). Comm has also been shown to 
regulate the delivery of Robo to the growth cone (141). Muscle surface accumulation 
of Comm and innervation defects are observed when dNedd4 is knocked down by 
RNAi in the muscle or in muscles overexpressing catalytically inactive dNedd4. Ex-
pression of Comm mutants fused to a single ubiquitin which cannot be polyubiquiti-
nated prevents the defects in both Comm endocytosis and synaptogenesis, suggesting 
that monoubiquitination is sufficient for Comm endocytosis in muscles (125). Expres-
sion of Comm mutants after synaptic innervation has no effect.  
Another regulator of axon growth is the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) 
(Table 1). The APC is a multimeric ubiquitin ligase complex that is well known to 
mediate progression through the cell cycle (222, 223). In the brain, the APC im-
munopurifies as a catalytically active ubiquitin ligase from brain extracts and is 
present in postmitotic neurons (91). Knocking down the APC co-activator Cdh1 in 
dissociated cerebellar granule neurons using RNA interference (RNAi) increased 
axonal growth rates while leaving dendritic growth unaltered (156). Dominant nega-
tive forms of the catalytic APC11 subunit (172, 271), as well as the APC inhibitor 
Emi1 (234, 235), likewise increase axonal growth rates. Similarly, Cdh1-depleted 
neurons in vitro grow over myelinated substrates and exhibit random growth patterns 
when plated on cerebellar slices, while in vivo, the parallel fibers of cerebellar gran-
ule neurons transfected with Cdh1-specific RNAi defasciculate and move away from 
normal anatomic pathways (156).  
subsequently degraded (Table 1) (118). Robo, Comm, and DCC/Fra have also been 
implicated in dendritic growth, indicating that ubiquitin-dependent regulation of guid-
ance molecule receptors is not restricted to axons (87).  
The APCCdh1 also targets inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) and the transcriptional 
corepressor SnoN for degradation (Fig. 4) (164, 265). Id2 is a member of the Id fam-
ily of proteins linked to cell proliferation and tumor progression. Id2 inhibits basic 
helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factors that limit axonal growth. Activation of 
APCCdh1 targets Id2 for degradation through a destruction box motif (D box) motif 
conserved in Id1 and Id4. Id2 D box mutants, which are resistant to APCCdh1 degrada-
tion, enhance axonal growth in cerebellar granule neurons and overcome the myelin 
inhibitory signals for growth (164). Conversely, bHLH activation induces genes with 
strong axonal inhibitory functions including the Nogo receptor, a known effector of 
myelin inhibition (164). The APCCdh1 has also been shown to operate in the nucleus 
and inhibit axonal growth and patterning in the mammalian brain (265). The APCCdh1 
has been shown to physically interact with SnoN initiating the ubiquitin-dependent 
proteasomal degradation of SnoN in rat cerebellar granule neurons in vitro. RNAi 
knockdown of SnoN reduces axonal growth and suppresses APCCdh1 RNAi-enhanced 
axon outgrowth (265). Furthermore, in vivo knockdown of SnoN in developing rat 
cerebellum significantly impairs the development of granule neuron parallel fibers by 
inhibiting their growth and/or stabilization (265). These findings point to the APCCdh1 
as an important mediator in the control of axonal morphogenesis."

Fig. 4. The UPS regulates many aspects of synaptic physiology.  
Presynaptic monoubiquitination (Mono-Ub) modulates endocytosis and interactions of endo-
cytic adaptors. Polyubiquitination (Poly-Ub) and proteasomal degradation alter the abundance 
of synaptic proteins. Presynaptic effects include (1) the regulation of neurotransmitter release 
by proteolysis of Munc-13, (2) regulation of vesicle dynamics by Ca2+ and calcineurin-
dependent modulation of fat facets/FAM activity on epsin 1, (3) regulation of synapse growth 
and development by Highwire/RPM-1, FSN-1, and the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) fat 
facets/FAM, and (4) APCCdh1 regulation of the axonal transcription factor Id2. Usp14 helps 
maintain the cellular pool of free Ub monomers by recycling them after protein degradation. 
The UPS also has profound influences on PSD proteins. These include (1) spine elimination 
through UPS-dependent degradation of the actin-organizing molecule SPAR, (2) activity-
dependent remodeling of the PSD through degradation of PSD scaffolds AKAP79/150 
(AKAP), GKAP, and Shank, (3) modulation of downstream signaling by SCFβTrCP-dependent 
degradation of β-catenin, (4) regulation of glutamate receptor abundance by the APC and 
SCFFbx2, (5) degradation of PSD-95 by Mdm2, and (6) regulation of CaMKII mRNA by the 
RISC protein armitage. See text for details. 
 
Another ubiquitin ligase involved in axon growth and targeting is LIN-23 (Table 1). 
LIN-23 is part of the F-box family of proteins, which recognize substrates as part of 
SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes (224, 256). In Caenorhabditis elegans, SCFLIN-23 
mutants exhibit excessive embryonic cell proliferation (145), while animals with a"

P610S point mutation in the C-terminus of LIN-23 exhibit axonal sprouting defects 
in sensory neurons and interneurons as well as abnormal motor neuron axon out-
growth, but do not demonstrate alterations in cell division (193). These results show 
that LIN-23 activity is important for multiple stages of nervous system development.  
Further evidence from Xenopus retinal ganglion neurons demonstrates that the 
UPS is important for growth cone steering. Isolated growth cones from Xenopus 
retinal ganglion neurons are highly enriched with ubiquitin, proteasomes, and E1 
enzymes. In addition, pharmacological blockade of the proteasome leads to a de-
crease in growth cone sensitivity to extracellular guidance molecules (39, 282). 
These findings show that the presence of a functional UPS is essential for proper 
axonal growth and guidance.  
Further supporting a role for the UPS in axon guidance is the finding that Rnf6, a 
RING domain ubiquitin ligase, targets LIM kinase 1 in mammalian neurons (Table 1, 
Fig. 4) (278). LIM kinase 1 is a Rho GTPase effector that modulates cellular mor-
phology via phosphorylation of the actin depolymerizing factor cofilin (7, 306). 
Cofilin phosphorylation disrupts its association with actin, thereby increasing fila-
mentous actin in the cell. Proteasomal inhibition in hippocampal neurons leads to 
increased levels of LIM kinase 1 while Rnf6, which polyubiquitinates LIM kinase 1 
in vitro, has been shown to coimmunoprecipitate along with LIM kinase 1 (278). 
Rnf6 localizes to growth cones, and overexpression of an Rnf6 mutant lacking its 
RING domain and RNAi knockdown of Rnf6 both increase axon growth (278). In 
contrast, wild-type Rnf6 overexpression suppresses axon growth (278). It is widely 
accepted that local actin polymerization and depolymerization are important con-
tributors to axon formation and growth (29), and thus localized proteasomal activity 
may be involved in modulating actin cytoskeletal changes that induce directional 
extension of neurites. 
The UPS also influences neuronal differentiation by modulating the levels and 
activity of small GTPases such as Rap1B and Rho family members. Sequential 
Rap1B-Cdc42 activity is needed for establishment of hippocampal neuron polarity. 
Furthermore, Rap1B is initially present at the tips of all neurites of unpolarized early 
stage 2 neurons, but is then later restricted to a single late stage 2 neurite (249). The 
confinement of Rap1B is required to establish neuronal polarity, and recent evidence 
points to selective degradation of Rap1B by the UPS as a mechanism to discriminate 
which neurite becomes an axon. The HECT domain E3 ligase Smurf2 regulates 
neurite extension and polarity through Rap1B (Table 1, Fig. 4). Smurf2 ubiquitinates 
inactive Rap1B, initiating its degradation via the UPS. In cultured, stage 3 rat hippo-
campal neurons, overexpression of wild-type Smurf2 leads to a loss of neuronal 
polarity while overexpression of a catalytically inactive Smurf2 mutant results in 
neurons with supernumerary axons and a significant reduction in minor neurites 
(248). Thus, the E3 ligase Smurf2 modulates axonal outgrowth by ubiquitinating 
Rap1B, initiating its UPS degradation. The degradation of Rap1B then allows the 
restriction of axonal outgrowth to a single neurite. Intriguingly, in non-neuronal 
cells, Par6 phosphorylation recruits Smurf1 which in turn degrades RhoA to locally 
regulate cell polarity, migration, and motility (214, 240, 292). Similar mechanisms 
have been shown to control neurite outgrowth (34)."

The UPS is also involved in axonal degeneration. Axonal degeneration is a 
common pathological characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases. In studies 
of rat transected axons, termed Wallerian degeneration, pharmacological and genetic 
inhibition of the UPS markedly delays axon degeneration both in vitro and in vivo 
(312). Also, similar to transected axons, degeneration of axons from nerve growth 
factor (NGF)-deprived sympathetic neurons is also suppressed by proteasome inhibi-
tors (312). In a further study of both developmental and Wallerian axonal degenera-
tion, Wlds mutant mice, which overexpress a chimeric protein consisting of the first 
70 amino acids of the UPS protein UFD2/E4 and the full-length nicotinamide mono-
nucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat), an enzyme that facilitates NAD synthesis, 
protects against degeneration of injury-induced retinal ganglion cells (115). In  
contrast, overexpression of the Wlds protein does not effect the naturally occurring 
degeneration of these same axonal projections during the identical developmental 
time period (115). These data indicate that naturally occurring developmental degen-
erative axonal pruning and injury-induced axon degeneration differ significantly in 
early steps, but may ultimately converge onto a common pathway which may  
involve the UPS.  
3.2 The UPS in Synapse Formation and Elimination  
3.2.1 Pam/Highwire/RPM-1  
One of the first links discovered between the UPS and synapses was the isolation of 
the Drosophila mutant highwire (hiw). The hiw mutant results from a disruption in 
the function of a RING domain E3 ligase (290, 304), resulting in a variety of mor-
phological and signaling defects at neuromuscular synapses (Table 1, Fig. 5) (304). 
Specifically, highwire loss-of-function mutations result in excessive synaptic bouton 
formation and reductions in both quantal size and content (290, 304). Interestingly, 
hiw loss-of-function mutants are phenocopied by the gain of function in a deubiquit-
inating enzyme called fat facets (Table 1, Fig. 4) (37, 63, 121). Such a phenotypic 
similarity shows that a proper balance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination 
events is critical for synaptic development. 
Interestingly, the conserved Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 class of proteins, consisting 
of Drosophila highwire, its C. elegans ortholog RPM-1, and the mammalian 
orthologs Phr1 and Pam are all involved in synapse development (36, 101, 244, 290, 
314). As discussed above, highwire mutants in Drosophila display normal neuro-
muscular junction motor axon targeting and synaptogenesis, but synapse growth is 
excessive with increases in both the number of boutons and the overall length of 
axonal branches (Fig. 5) (290). Similarly, RPM-1 loss-of-function C. elegans mu-
tants display retracted synaptic branches, ectopically extended axons, and altered 
NMJ phenotypes including motor neuron overgrowth which often manifests as a 
single large presynaptic terminal with multiple active zones (Fig. 5) (244, 314). 
Moreover, mice lacking the RPM-1 ortholog Phr1 exhibit incomplete diaphragm 
innervation by the phrenic nerve, and at a more detailed level, nerve terminal mor-
phologies are disrupted as NMJs show excessive postsynaptic sprouting of nerve 
terminals (36)."

Fig. 5. The Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 (PHR) family of ubiquitin ligases regulates synapse forma-
tion and function. In flies (highwire), worms (RPM-1), and mammals (Pam/Phr), PHR family 
ubiquitin ligases control axonal sprouting, synapse morphology, and maintenance of synaptic 
transmission. Loss-of-function mutations in the Highwire/RPM-1/Pam E3 ligase result in 
synaptic defects including excessive synaptic bouton formation and reductions in both quantal 
size and content, retracted synaptic branches, ectopically extended axons, and excessive post-
synaptic accumulation of nerve terminals. Phenotypes vary between worms, flies, and mam-
mals, but have been best studied at the Drosophila neuromuscular synapse, and mechanosen-
sory and motor synapses in C. elegans. 
 
In addition to the conserved function of the Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 class of pro-
teins, the signaling components of the highwire pathway are also conserved. A genetic 
screen in Drosophila for modulators of the highwire phenotype identified mutations in 
wallenda, a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase (MAPK.KK) of the 
p38 pathway (52).  
While mutations in highwire lead to neuromuscular synapse defects, this pheno-
type is suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in wallenda, which is consistent 
with the idea that wallenda is negatively regulated by highwire (52). In C. elegans, 
screens for suppressors of the RPM-1 loss-of-function phenotype identified the 
wallenda homolog DLK-1 (204). DLK-1 loss-of-function mutants show no signifi-
cant changes in synaptic growth, but DLK-1 loss of function in an RPM-1 mutant 
background suppresses the RPM-1 mutant synaptic overgrowth phenotype (204). 
Although the complete pathway remains to be elucidated, these data indicate that 
Highwire/RPM-1 modulates a key signaling pathway involving the p38 MAPK 
pathway that promotes synaptic growth. Intriguingly, the T10H9.2 receptor tyrosine 
kinase, a homolog of the mammalian brain-specific anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(127), is regulated by RPM-1 and the F-box protein FSN-1 in C. elegans (174, 204).

3.2.2 Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC)  
In addition to its role in axonal outgrowth, the APC also promotes differentiation of 
presynaptic boutons and formation of functional synapses at Drosophila neuromuscu-
lar synapses (Table 1). Mutations in components of the APC lead to alterations in neu-
romuscular synapse development. Flies expressing a truncated form of the cullin do-
main APC component protein APC2 survive to early pupal stages and display 
expanded neuromuscular synapse size (280). This augmentation in synaptic size results 
from a twofold increase in the number of presynaptic terminals per endplate without an 
increase in the size of individual boutons (280). These malformations correspond to 
enhanced spontaneous and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents and an increase in 
postsynaptic clustering of glutamate receptors. Mutations in APC subunits in C. ele-
gans increase the abundance of GLR-1 in the ventral nerve cord resulting in locomotor 
defects consistent with increased synaptic strength (134). Mutations that disrupt 
clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibit the effects of the APC mutations, indicating that 
the APC regulates GLR-1 endocytosis or endocytic recycling (134). 
Recent studies at the mammalian neuromuscular junction have identified a PDZ 
domain containing RING finger 3 (PDZRN3) as a synapse-associated E3 ubiquitin 
ligase that regulates the surface expression of the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine 
kinase (MuSK) (Table 1), the key organizer of postsynaptic NMJ development (181). 
PDZRN3 binds to MuSK and promotes its ubiquitination, leading to endocytic re-
moval of MuSK from the muscle membrane. Gain- and loss-of-function studies in 
cultured myotubes and transgenic mice show that downregulation of MuSK by 
 
and overdeveloped synapses including presynaptic densities with single, presynaptic 
vesicle clusters or undifferentiated synaptic varicosities with single clusters of synap-
tic vesicles (Fig. 3, right) (244, 314). RPM-1 is part of a cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase 
complex where the F-box component, such as FSN-1, is interchangeable and deter-
mines substrate specificity (Table 1) (5). The multiple effects of RPM-1/FSN-1 loss-
of-function mutants may indicate the existence of synapse-specific cullin-RING 
complexes that direct the growth and maturation of distinct synapses by targeting 
discrete substrates, such as DLK-1, in certain synaptic populations. 
Another putative neuronal substrate for the APC, liprin-α, was identified 
through database homology screens using the conserved APC destruction box motif 
RXXLXXXXN as a template (Fig. 4) (95, 144, 280). Liprin-α has been shown to 
affect NMJ bouton numbers in flies (139) while its C. elegans ortholog, SYD2, regu-
lates synapse size and function (315). Furthermore, the multi-PDZ domain protein 
GRIP/ABP binds to liprin-α and, through an association with LAR receptor protein 
tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs), clusters AMPA receptors at mammalian exci-
tatory synapses (Table 1) (305). Loss-of-function APCmr3 (the Drosophila ortholog 
of APC2) mutant flies show a 33% increase in presynaptic levels of liprin-α, while a 
simultaneous expression of loss function liprin-α rescues the APCmr3 phenotype 
(280). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that liprin-α is in 
a monoubiquitinated form in vivo (280). These data indicate that the APC can modu-
late liprin-α activity during synapse development."

PDZRN3 plays an important role in MuSK-mediated nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 
clustering and synapse maturation.  
3.2.3 Dendritic Pruning  
In addition to the elimination of individual synapses, entire dendrite segments un-
dergo developmental retraction and loss in a manner regulated by the UPS. Droso-
phila larvae class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons undergo extensive den-
dritic pruning during metamorphosis and this pruning is regulated by UPS activity 
(158). Specifically, mutations in the Drosophila E1 enzyme uba1 and the proteasome 
subunit mov34 prevent pruning of C4da neuron larval dendrites during metamorpho-
sis (158). Subsequent genetic screens identified the E2-conjugating enzyme UbcD1 
and the RING E3 ligase Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (DIAP1) as key 
components in the pruning of C4da dendrites (Table 1) (159). The antiapoptotic 
protein DIAP1 protects neurons from apoptosis by downregulating Dronc caspase 
activity by targeting Dronc for proteasomal degradation (201, 299). Loss of DIAP1 
leads to increased Dronc activity resulting in caspase activation and cleavage of 
proximal dendrites in C4da neurons during metamorphosis. C4da neurons lacking 
Dronc have normal dendrites at early larval stages but fail to cleave their larval  
Similar to synapse formation, the UPS also regulates synapse elimination. The 
spine-associated Rap GTPase-activating protein (SPAR) (Fig. 4), an actin-binding 
positive regulator of spine growth that localizes to the PSD via its interaction with 
postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) (217), undergoes proteasomal degradation 
after phosphorylation by serum-inducible kinase (SNK, Table 1), also known as 
polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2) (216). SPAR overexpression creates enlarged spines with 
increased PSD-95 content in cultured hippocampal neurons. Conversely, SNK/Plk2 
overexpression with simultaneous phosphorylation of SPAR eliminates spines (216, 
217). SNK and SPAR are thus thought to play a role in homeostatic synaptic plastic-
ity by dampening synaptic signaling during chronic increases in activity (see chapter 
by Turrigiano, this issue).  
The UPS is also involved in synapse elimination in C. elegans. In adult worms, 
the hermaphrodite-specific motor neuron (HSNL) interfaces with its vulval muscle 
and VC motor neuron targets via a cluster of synapses in the primary synapse region 
(PSR). Experiments have shown that stereotypical developmental elimination of 
HSNL synapses is mediated by an SCF E3 ligase complex consisting of SKR-1 and 
the F-box protein SEL-10 (65). RNAi knockdown of SKR-1 and another obligatory 
component of the SCF complex CUL-1 resulted in a marked decrease in synapse 
elimination in the PSR over control animals (65). Furthermore, the immunoglobulin 
superfamily synaptic adhesion molecule SYG-1 (NEPH1 and IrreC in mouse and 
Drosophila, respectively), which is exclusively expressed in the PSR during devel-
opmental stages, binds to SKR-1 (65) and inhibits SCF complex assembly. This 
inhibition results in protection of local synapses in the PSR (65). These data indicate 
that the localization and regulation of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation  
can contribute to maintaining detailed synaptic connectivity via selective synapse 
elimination."

dendrites during metamorphosis (159). Mutations in UbcD1 also lead to retention of 
intact, non-severed larval dendrites 18 h after puparium formation (APF), whereas 
wild-type C4da neurons lose dendrites over this same period (159). Furthermore, 
gain-of-function DIAP1 mutants hinder larval neuron dendrite pruning. These ex-
periments emphasize the importance of the UPS in large-scale remodeling of den-
drites and postsynaptic contacts during development. 
4 The UPS in Synaptic Function 
4.1 UPS-Dependent Mechanisms of Presynaptic Regulation 
Recent studies indicate that dynamic cycles of ubiquitination and deubiquitination in 
presynaptic terminals regulate neurotransmitter release. In isolated synaptosomes, 
acute depolarization causes a rapid decrease in ubiquitin-immunopositive proteins 
(44). This loss of ubiquitin conjugates is Ca2+ dependent and is blocked by inhibitors 
of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin/PP2B (44). Furthermore, proteasome 
inhibitors only partially block the depolarization-induced loss of ubiquitin conju-
gates, indicating that the loss of ubiquitin immunoreactivity is due principally to 
deubiquitination rather than proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this notion, 
RNAi knockdown of FAM, a mammalian ortholog of the DUB fat facets, causes the 
UIM protein epsin-1 to remain monoubiquitinated after depolarization, in turn alter-
ing presynaptic vesicle release dynamics by altering adaptor interactions involving 
components of the endocytic pathway (Table 1, Fig. 4) (44). 
Ubiquitin recycling and regulation of free pools of monomeric ubiquitin also 
play an important role in regulating neuronal function. The ataxia mouse, which 
displays severe tremors and undergoes premature death (57, 300), is deficient in the 
DUB enzyme Usp14 (Table 1), a mammalian homolog of the yeast deubiquitinating 
enzyme Ubp6 (300). Usp14/Ubp6 directly interacts with the proteasome and func-
tions to remove and recycle ubiquitin molecules from ubiquitinated proteins bound to 
the proteasome (Fig. 4) (26, 170). Interestingly, wild-type mice have 35% greater 
monomeric ubiquitin levels in neural tissues compared to ataxia mice (4). This de-
crease in free ubiquitin seen in ataxia mice can be rescued in the brain by expression 
of a full-length Usp14 transgene (56). Electrophysiological characteristics of ataxia 
mice, including defects in hippocampal short-term plasticity as well as increased 
amplitudes but decreased frequencies of miniature endplate potentials at neuromus-
cular synapses, suggest that Usp14 defects alter presynaptic function (300). 
Protein degradation after ubiquitination also has significant effects on presynap-
tic function. In cultured hippocampal neurons, proteasome inhibitors increased FM-
dye uptake after a 1 min, 90 mM K+ depolarization, by more than 75% over control, 
whereas the rate and magnitude of dye release were unaltered (296). This increase in 
FM-dye uptake is not dependent on protein synthesis but does require neuronal activ-
ity as it is blocked by TTX and augmented by elevating action potential frequency 
through blockade of inhibitory GABAA receptors (296). These observations indicate 
that proteasomal degradation at the presynaptic terminal negatively regulates neuro-
transmitter release during times of increased activity. The relevant ubiquitin ligases"

that control vesicle cycling in presynaptic terminals are not yet known, but may 
include members of the ZNRF family of RING domain E3 ligases that associate with 
synaptic membranes and regulate Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in PC12 cells (6). 
4.2 The Ubiquitin–Proteasome System in Postsynaptic Remodeling  
and Plasticity 
Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are considered cellu-
lar models for learning and memory (22, 23, 177, 185) (see chapter by Lisman and 
Hell, this volume). Both LTP and LTD are Ca2+-dependent processes requiring the 
activation of kinase and phosphatase cascades, which lead to synaptic strengthening 
or weakening, respectively (119, 186, 199, 200). LTP and LTD result in long-lasting 
alterations in synaptic strength caused by enduring changes in synapse structure and 
protein composition. Traditionally, changes in macromolecular synthesis, including 
gene transcription and local protein synthesis, were thought to cause long-lasting 
synaptic remodeling (142, 143, 267). However, recent evidence points to an  
important role for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in enduring synaptic 
modification. 
 
Potential presynaptic proteasome substrates include the vesicle priming protein 
Munc-13, which plays an important role in action potential-evoked neurotransmitter 
release (13, 33, 260). Pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome or genetic altera-
tion of the proteasome was found to increase the accumulation of Munc-13, resulting 
in decreased neurotransmitter release (33, 260). Conversely, anisomycin, a protein 
synthesis inhibitor, had no effect on synaptic currents, demonstrating the specific 
involvement of protein degradation (260). Interestingly, RIM1, which is a binding 
partner for Munc-13, is degraded by the synaptic F-box E3 ligase SCRAPPER. 
Scrapper knockout mice display elevated levels of RIM1 and altered synaptic activ-
ity (Table 1) (308).  
Ubiquitin-dependent protein trafficking also controls neurotransmitter reuptake 
into nerve terminals. The HECT domain E3 ligase Nedd4-2 has been shown to regu-
late dopamine transporter surface expression (see Table 1). The dopamine transporter 
(DAT) is localized to dopaminergic neurons where it functions to transport extracel-
lular dopamine (DA) into DA neurons, leading to a termination of DA signaling. The 
dynamic nature of expression of DATs at the neuronal cell surface determines the 
duration and spatial limitation of dopaminergic neurotransmission. DAT activity, in 
turn, is regulated by endocytic trafficking. Large-scale RNAi experiments disrupting 
PKC-dependent endocytosis assays involving HA-tagged DAT (HA-DAT) in cul-
tured rat neurons revealed that Nedd4-2, as well as adaptor proteins such as epsin, 
Eps15, and Eps15R, are involved in modulating surface expression of DAT. RNAi 
depletion of Nedd4-2 results in a dramatic reduction of PKC-dependent ubiquitina-
tion of DAT (259). Furthermore, endogenous Nedd4-2, epsin, and Eps15 coim-
munoprecipitated with endogenous DAT isolated from rat striatum (259) indicating 
direct interactions between DAT and the endocytic machinery. These data indicate 
that PKC-induced ubiquitination of DAT is mediated by Nedd4-2, which leads to an 
interaction of DAT with adaptor proteins in coated pits accelerating DAT endocytosis."

4.2.1 The UPS in Synaptic Plasticity  
The importance of the UPS in synaptic plasticity was first noted in behavioral condi-
tioning studies of Aplysia (28, 58, 194). During long-term facilitation (LTF), a para-
digm similar to LTP, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity continues even 
after cAMP levels return to baseline concentrations (105). In the absence of cAMP, 
inactivated PKA exists as a holoenzyme consisting of two catalytic subunits whose 
activity is suppressed by a dimeric regulatory subunit. As cAMP concentrations 
increase, four cAMP molecules interact with the regulatory dimer, releasing the 
constitutively active catalytic subunits (see chapter by Hell and Strack, this volume). 
When cAMP levels return to baseline, the holoenzyme reforms, inactivating PKA 
catalytic activity. During LTF, PKA activation is accompanied by UPS degradation 
of its regulatory subunits, leading to persistent PKA activity without elevated cAMP 
levels (42, 90, 196, 231). Intriguingly, ubiquitin recycling also increases during LTF 
further enhancing degradative events. Specifically, the level of Aplysia ubiquitin C-
terminal hydrolase Ap-uch, an ortholog of mammalian UCH-L1, is increased follow-
ing the induction of LTF leading to amplified disassembly of polyubiquitin chains 
and thus a larger free pool of ubiquitin (Table 1, Fig. 4) (105, 106). 
Protein degradation by the UPS is also important for the generation of short-
term and long-term memory in concert with protein synthesis. For example, the well-
defined odor-shock learning paradigm in Drosophila involves an increase in the 
expression of genes involved in mRNA transport as well as local translation (277). 
These events are regulated by components of the RNA interference (RISC) pathway. 
In particular, armitage, a component of the RISC pathway, inversely regulates synaptic 
CaMKII expression in Drosophila in response to synaptic activity. As synaptic activ-
ity increases, armitage expression decreases, leading to increased expression of 
CaMKII and subsequent postsynaptic enhancement (54). Armitage itself is targeted 
for degradation by the UPS (Fig. 4). In Drosophila brain, activity-dependent loss of 
armitage was prevented by a dominant-negative mutant of the proteasome β-subunit 
(DTS5) (8). Furthermore, incubation with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin 
blocked nicotine-induced loss of GFP:Armi during periods of increased neuronal 
activity associated with memory (8).  
Although it has been well documented that long-term changes in synaptic effi-
cacy rely on protein synthesis, recent evidence indicates an equally important role for 
protein degradation in establishing late-phase LTP at hippocampal synapses. Both 
early and late phases of LTP induced by high-frequency stimulation are reduced at 
Schaeffer collateral CA1 synapses after the application of proteasome inhibitors (83, 
136). Interestingly, coapplication of protein synthesis inhibitors along with protea-
some inhibitors largely restores late LTP (83), indicating a delicate balance of pro-
duction and destruction of plasticity-associated proteins. The precise identity of these 
plasticity-associated proteins remains to be discovered. 
While the majority of UPS components and targets involved in LTP/LTD are 
not yet known, the HECT domain E3 ligase Ube3a/E6-AP has been shown to regu-
late synaptic plasticity. The involvement of Ube3a in synaptic function was first 
observed in mice lacking the maternal allele of Ube3a (130). These mice exhibit 
abnormal motor coordination and defects in spatial learning and hippocampal LTP. 
These characteristics are thought to be analogous to those of Angelman syndrome, a"

4.2.2 UPS-Dependent Remodeling of the PSD  
The PSD is a biochemically complex and persistent structure with a highly organized 
framework of protein scaffolds (251). Despite its biochemical stability, the PSD 
undergoes structural changes in response to alterations in synaptic activity (68, 69, 
88, 104, 188, 202, 207, 211, 275). Long-term time-lapse imaging has revealed con-
tinuous turnover and remodeling of the PSD structural protein PSD-95 at excitatory 
synapses. In addition, fluorescence photobleaching experiments have revealed sig-
nificant ongoing exchange of PSD proteins (97, 250, 276). Biochemical pulse-chase 
experiments have demonstrated that the aggregate turnover rate of PSD-associated 
proteins is on the order of hours (69). Evidence now indicates that these dynamic 
molecular changes are at least partially mediated by the UPS.  
Biochemically isolated PSD fractions have long been known to be rich in ubiq-
uitin-immunopositive components (43). Recent studies show that altering the amount 
of neuronal activity causes reciprocal changes in global protein composition of the 
PSD (Fig. 6) (69). Correlating with these protein compositional changes, decreasing 
synaptic activity diminishes ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in the PSD and decreases 
protein turnover, whereas increasing synaptic activity increases ubiquitin conjugation 
and accelerates protein turnover (Fig. 6) (69). These results indicate that the rate of 
postsynaptic protein turnover is tightly tuned by synaptic activity during molecular 
remodeling.  
To date, few PSD-associated proteins have been shown to be directly ubiquiti-
nated. However, among the known targets of ubiquitination are major PSD scaffold 
proteins including Shank, GKAP/SAPAP, AKAP79/150, and PSD-95 (51, 69). In 
addition, the postsynaptic spine-associated Rap GTPase and actin regulatory protein 
SPAR undergoes activity and phosphorylation-dependent degradation (216). Fur-
thermore, Vesl-1S/Homer-1a, which is known as a binding partner of Shank and 
mGluR1/5, is also degraded by the UPS, and its synaptic localization is enhanced by 
the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin (1, 2). Thus, UPS targeting of 
important structural PSD proteins for degradation may alter the relative ratios of 
critical protein subtypes at the postsynaptic membrane. 
 
hereditary neurodevelopmental disorder where the loss of the maternal copy of 
Ube3a leads to cognitive, behavioral, and neurological deficits. The neuronal sub-
strates of Ube3a are unknown; however, recent evidence indicates that Ube3a regu-
lates the activity CaMKII, a critical plasticity molecule for LTP (see chapter by Lis-
man and Hell, this volume). Maternally deficient Ube3a mice show increased 
phosphorylation of threonines 286 and 305 of CaMKII leading to a corresponding 
reduction in kinase activity. This inhibition is due to the dominant effect of phos-
phorylation at the inhibitory threonine 305 site and reduced postsynaptic localization 
(281, 293). One attractive possibility is that Ube3a positively regulates CaMKII 
activity by degrading a yet to be determined negative regulator of a CaMKII phos-
phatase. The loss of Ube3a from neurons leads to increased CaMKII phosphorylation 
at threonine 305 and decreased CaMKII activity with corresponding deficits in syn-
aptic plasticity."

Activity-dependent changes in synaptic composition correlate with alterations in 
the distribution of proteasomes in neurons (20). Live imaging of neurons expressing 
GFP-tagged 19S and 20S subunit components Rpt1 and α4, respectively, showed 
that these proteins are ubiquitously distributed in dendrites at resting membrane 
potentials. After strong, continuous KCl-induced depolarization, proteasomes are 
redistributed into spines (20). This proteasomal spine enrichment is sensitive to 
NMDA receptor inhibition by AP5, and fluorescence photobleaching experiments 
indicate that spines retain an increasingly immobile pool of proteasomes in response 
to activity (20). Correspondingly, elevated neuronal activity increases the detergent-
insoluble, actin-associated fraction of neuronal proteasomes (20). These experiments 
indicate a model where NMDA receptor activation induces local reorganization of 
the actin cytoskeleton in spines leading to changes in proteasome localization.

4.3 Ubiquitin and Postsynaptic Receptor Trafficking 
Forward genetic studies in C. elegans have been instrumental in identifying UPS 
adaptor proteins and ubiquitin ligases involved in postsynaptic glutamate receptor 
trafficking. While experiments have clearly demonstrated that glutamate receptors in 
C. elegans undergo direct ubiquitination (35), detecting ubiquitination of mammalian 
glutamate receptors has been more elusive. In this section, we will highlight key 
experiments involving glutamate receptor trafficking in both C. elegans and mam-
mals and point out possible mechanistic differences between the two systems. We 
will also discuss the UPS-dependent effects on trafficking of GABAA and nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in mammals. 
4.3.1 Glutamate Receptor Regulation in C. elegans  
Ubiquitination of the GLR-1 glutamate receptor at C. elegans synapses causes recep-
tor elimination from the postsynaptic membrane through an endocytotic mechanism 
involving the clathrin adaptor protein AP180 (35). While seemingly unrelated, APC 
loss-of-function mutants exhibit locomotor deficits that correspond to increases in 
postsynaptic levels of GLR-1 and synapse size (Table 1) (134). This is similar to the 
findings that Drosophila APC mutants have enlarged synapses, increased postsynap-
tic glutamate receptor clustering, and deficits in synaptic transmission at the neuro-
muscular synapse (280). Although GLR-1 has not been shown to be a direct sub-
strate of the APC, the APC loss-of-function phenotype is suppressed by loss of 
function of the unc-11/AP180 clathrin adaptor, indicating that APC activity is linked 
to the endocytotic pathway (134). The APC has not been localized to the synapse, 
although in Drosophila, the APC controls presynaptic size via liprin-α (280), which 
is known to organize the presynaptic active zone and regulate neurotransmitter re-
lease (Fig. 4). 
In a previous section, we noted that LIN-23 is important in axonal outgrowth 
(193). Recent genetic experiments have also shown that LIN-23 is a negative regula-
tor of synaptic GLR-1 levels in the ventral nerve cord of C. elegans (Table 1) (66). 
LIN-23 shares sequence similarity to the mammalian F-box protein β-TrCP, a key 
component of the Wnt signaling pathway. During Wnt signaling, β-catenin binds to 
the TCF/Lef family of transcription factors, thereby upregulating the expression of 
Wnt target genes (17, 122). Low levels of Wnt expression cause β-catenin to associ-
ate with a destruction complex where β-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen syn-
thase kinase-3β. Phosphorylated β-catenin is then recognized by β-TrCP and tar-
geted for proteasomal degradation (165, 220, 301, 309). Similar to the function of β-
TrCP in mammalian cells, SCFLIN-23 targets the C. elegans β-catenin ortholog BAR-1 
for degradation (66). The effects of loss-of-function mutants of LIN-23 on GLR-1 
clustering are rescued by an unc-11/AP180 loss of function mutant, suggesting that 
SCFLIN-23 promotes GLR-1 endocytosis. The receptor clustering phenotype in LIN-
23 knockout animals can be partially rescued by loss of function of the TCF/Lef 
homolog POP-1. This indicates that GLR-1 is also a target gene of Wnt signaling 
(66) and SCFLIN-23 negatively regulates GLR-1 expression through both the endo-
cytic pathway and gene transcription."

Another UPS protein shown to interact with GLR-1 is KEL-8. KEL-8 is a broad 
complex tramtrack bric-a-brac (BTB)-Kelch protein that directly associates with 
CUL-3, a scaffold component of cullin-RING family E3 ligases (224), imparting 
substrate specificity to the E3 ligase. KEL-8 localizes to sites adjacent to GLR-1 
postsynaptic clusters along ventral cord neurites, and KEL-8 mutant worms show an 
increased frequency of spontaneous reversal in locomotion indicative of changes in 
GLR-1 levels at synapses (245). Indeed, mutations in KEL-8 lead to increases in 
GLR-1 levels at postsynaptic clusters, while the levels and localization of other post-
synaptic proteins are unaltered (245). These results show that KEL-8 is involved in 
ubiquitin-mediated turnover of GLR-1 subunits, and that cullin-3 ubiquitin ligases 
are required for the turnover of GLR-1 receptors. 
4.3.2 The UPS and Glutamate Receptor Regulation at Mammalian Synapses  
One of the primary determinants of excitatory synaptic strength is the number of 
AMPA receptors expressed at the postsynaptic surface (see chapter by Esteban, this 
volume). AMPA receptors are endocytosed and sorted into various recycling or degra-
dative pathways in an activity-dependent fashion. Under conditions of minimal synap-
tic activity, AMPA receptors in hippocampal cultures undergo endocytosis in as little 
as 14 min. However, during periods of increased neuronal activity, AMPA receptor 
endocytosis is accelerated by threefold (70). AMPA receptor internalization can also be 
triggered by direct ligand binding or by NMDA or insulin receptor activation (15, 31, 
41, 70, 175, 183). While both direct and indirect activation can initiate AMPA receptor 
internalization, the fate of the endocytosed receptors depends on the nature of the stim-
uli. Activation of AMPA receptors alone directs receptors to be sorted for degradation 
while NMDA receptor activation alone leads to AMPA receptor recycling (70, 169).  
Unlike C. elegans GLR-1 receptors, which undergo direct ubiquitination (35), 
mammalian AMPA receptors can be internalized indirectly through ubiquitination of 
the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 by the RING domain ubiquitin ligase 
Mdm2 (Table 1, Fig. 4) (51). In hippocampal neurons, NMDA-dependent PSD-95 
ubiquitination is inhibited in the absence of Ca2+ or in the presence of the calcineurin 
inhibitor ascomycin, (51) suggesting that Mdm2 and calcineurin function in the same 
pathway with calcineurin operating upstream of Mdm2. Furthermore, overexpression 
of a ubiquitin mutant that allows monoubiquitnation, but not polyubiquitination, 
prevents AMPA-induced receptor endocytosis (219). While it has been shown that 
changes in PSD-95 levels can modulate synaptic AMPA receptor content (71-73, 
266), PSD-95 ubiquitination is not always detectable (21, 69). This may result from a 
tight regulation of PSD-95 ubiquitination or de-ubiquitination.  
The degradation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors is also regulated by the 
UPS. The F-box protein Fbx2, an SCF complex component, mediates activity-
dependent ubiquitination and degradation of NMDA receptor NR1 subunits by  
recognizing high mannose glycans in the N-terminal extracellular domain of NR1 
(Table 1, Fig. 4) (137). Such high mannose modifications are typically present on 
proteins trafficking through early stages of the secretory pathway including the en-
doplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi apparatus (107) (see chapter by Hanus and 
Ehlers, this volume). In neurons, Fbx2 localizes to dendritic spines, and expression"

of a dominant-negative form of Fbx2 leads to an increase in surface NMDA receptor 
expression (137), suggesting that ongoing ubiquitination of NR1 by Fbx2 in intracel-
lular compartments limits or interrupts forward trafficking.  
In a manner similar to ubiquitination, posttranslational modification of proteins 
by the small ubiquitin-like modifier protein (SUMO) alters protein trafficking and 
function. Although best known for its role in signaling within the nucleus, SUMOy-
lation occurs at the synapse, with one key target being the kainate-type glutamate 
receptor GluR6 (189). SUMOylation of GluR6 is increased in response to kainate 
and regulates endocytosis of the receptor. Correspondingly, kainate receptor-
mediated postsynaptic currents in hippocampal slices are bidirectionally regulated by 
SUMOylation and deSUMOylation (189). In addition to SUMOylation, GluR6 is 
ubiquitinated and binds actinfilin, a synaptic BTB-Kelch protein that acts as an adap-
tor for a Cul3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (242) in a manner surprisingly similar to 
the C. elegans GLR-1 receptor (245). Surface levels of GluR6 vary inversely with 
levels of actinfilin, suggesting that the actinfilin-Cul3 complex targets kainate recep-
tors for membrane removal and/or degradation (242). 
4.3.3 Trafficking of GABAA and Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors  
While glutamatergic receptors are the primary determinants of excitatory synaptic 
strength, GABAA receptors mediate rapid inhibitory synaptic transmission (see chapter 
by Lorena Arancibia-Carcamo et al., this issue). Certain GABAA receptor α- and β-
subunits have been shown to interact with protein linking IAP to cytoplasmic 1 (Plic-
1), an adaptor protein with an N-terminal UBL domain and a C-terminal UBA domain 
(Fig. 4) (16). In neurons, Plic-1 colocalizes with GABAA receptors by immunofluores-
cent imaging while electron microscopy shows Plic-1 in proximity to GABAA recep-
tors (16). Disruption of the Plic-1/GABAA receptor interaction reduces GABAA recep-
tor surface expression levels by 20%, indicating that Plic-1 enhances receptor 
expression at the plasma membrane (16). Pulse-chase experiments in the presence of 
the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin showed a 30% increase in the stability of recombi-
nant β3-containing GABAA receptors when coexpressed with Plic-1, indicating that 
GABAA subunit turnover is sensitive to proteasome inhibition (16). These results indi-
cate that the Plic-1 UBA domain may bind monoubiquitinated GABAA receptors pre-
venting polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the receptor. 
5 The Ubiquitin–Proteasome System in Neurological Disease 
A shared characteristic of several prevalent neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD), 
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the presence of ubiquitin-positive intracel-
lular inclusions (179, 180, 238, 254). The significance of ubiquitin-rich aggregates 
associated with the onset of these neurological disorders is not well understood. 
Ubiquitin-conjugated protein aggregation may be a mechanism for coping with the 
buildup of dysfunctional proteins or a direct consequence of the disorder itself. As 
more information points to the UPS as an important regulator of synapse develop-"

ment and function, the question naturally arises as to whether aberrant UPS function 
could lead to neurological disease by impaired synapse regulation and plasticity 
(238). Furthermore, mutations in UPS-linked genes have been shown to contribute to 
the etiology of heritable forms of neurodegenerative disorders such as familial Park-
inson’s disease and neurodevelopmental diseases such as Angelman syndrome 
whose underlying pathogenesis may involve synaptic dysfunction. 
5.1 Dysregulation of the UPS in Parkinson’s Disease 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a movement disorder resulting from a gradual degenera-
tion of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Approximately 1% of the popu-
lation older than 65 years is affected, of which only 5% of reported cases possess an 
inherited component (27). To date, several genes have been linked to the rare, inher-
ited forms of PD, and the identification of these genes has generated important clues 
into the mechanisms underlying an otherwise mysterious disease. Proteins encoded 
by PARK genes include α-synuclein (PARK1) (230), parkin (PARK2, Table 1) 
(150), UCH-L1 (PARK5) (171), phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chro-
mosome 10-induced kinase 1 or PINK-1 (PARK6) (279), DJ-1 (PARK7) (24), and 
leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (PARK8) (215). In this chapter, we focus on the role of 
parkin (PARK2) and its role in the etiology of familial PD. 
5.1.1 Parkin  
Parkin is a member of the RING class of E3 ligases. Structurally, parkin has a C-
terminal PDZ-binding domain (80) and a modified C-terminal in-between (IBR) RING 
domain flanked by two RING motifs. The N-terminus of parkin has a UBL domain 
that binds the Rpn10 subunit of the proteasome and is thought to aid the shuttling of 
ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation (241). Numerous mutations 
spanning the entire parkin gene result in PD phenotypes with detectable symptoms 
manifesting before the age of 30 (59). Interestingly, patients with PD-linked parkin 
mutations lack the accumulation of Lewy bodies commonly seen in patients with spo-
radic forms of the disease, suggesting that Lewy body deposits are not solely responsi-
ble for PD. One possibility is that parkin activity may be involved in the conjugation of 
ubiquitin to Lewy body components as evidenced by ubiquitinated forms of putative 
parkin substrates α-synuclein (255), synphilin (46), and parkin itself (45, 313), all of 
which have been shown to be present in Lewy bodies (27, 171).  
Parkin likely has diverse cellular roles as it localizes to both presynaptic and 
postsynaptic structures, including synaptic vesicles and dendritic vesicles as well as 
glial cell bodies (197). Parkin interacts with NMDA receptors and PSD-95 core 
components of the postsynaptic density at glutamatergic synapses indicating a poten-
tial role in postsynaptic function (80). Consistent with a role in synaptic transmis-
sion, parkin null mice show subtle behavioral deficits and altered excitability in the 
hippocampus and striatum (96, 126, 286). The diversity of disease-linked parkin 
mutations can lead to widely varying effects on E3 ligase activity, localization, and 
substrate binding (190, 262). While PD linked to parkin mutations most commonly 
follow a recessive inheritance trend, disease-linked mutations may lead to disruption"

or enhancement of parkin function (243, 262, 291), indicating the cellular effects of 
parkin mutations may not be simply due to loss of protein function.  
Of the many possible roles parkin may play in neuronal function, one common 
theme is neuroprotection. Levels of the parkin substrate cyclin E, a positive regulator 
of neuronal apoptosis (263), is increased in patients with parkin-linked PD. Overex-
pression of wild-type parkin in cultured neurons causes a reduction in cyclin E levels 
and a greater resistance to excitotoxic insult (263). Furthermore, excitotoxicity 
linked to overexpression of the parkin substrates α-synuclein and the Pael-1 receptor 
is reduced by coexpression of wild-type parkin (124, 225, 307). Through its N-
terminal UBL domain, parkin also interacts with the UIM-containing adaptor protein 
Eps15, and thereby regulates the internalization and trafficking of the epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) (53, 79). Eps15 is monoubiquitinated in the presence 
of EGF in a parkin-dependent manner reducing its binding to EGF receptors (79, 
195). Correspondingly, RNAi-mediated parkin knockdown increases the internaliza-
tion of EGF indicating that endogenous parkin prevents Eps15-dependent EGF re-
ceptor endocytosis (79). Interestingly, EGF receptor activation protects dopaminer-
gic neurons (79), and EGFR expression is decreased in the striata of patients with PD 
(128). Moreover, EGFR signaling activates the downstream kinase Akt (79), which 
is well known to mediate neuronal survival (67, 77, 138, 157, 226). These results 
suggest that the neuroprotective effect of parkin may arise from its ability to increase 
the cellular response to EGF through an Akt-dependent pathway. 
A complication in studying the function of parkin in normal neuronal physiol-
ogy or in PD pathways is that few putative parkin substrates show elevated expres-
sion levels in parkin null mice. Also, these parkin knockout mice do not exhibit 
dopaminergic neurodegeration (96, 98, 153, 221) further clouding the link between 
parkin function and disease phenotypes (284). One recent important clue in this 
regard is that dopamine itself covalently modifies parkin inactivating its ubiquitin 
ligase activity (166), suggesting a link to the progressive and selective loss of parkin 
activity in dopaminergic neurons during sporadic Parkinson’s disease. 
5.1.2 Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Angelman Syndrome  
Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe 
learning disabilities, ataxia, limited speech, inappropriate laughter, and seizures with 
no apparent neurodegeneration or gross brain morphology defects (297). Approxi-
mately 70% of cases of AS are caused by characteristic disruptions in the maternal 
chromosome 15q11-q13, leading to a microdeletion of chromosomal DNA (152). 
This deleted region contains genes for the GABAA receptor β3 subunit (GABRB3) 
and Ube3a, which encodes a HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligase generally accepted to 
be the primary genetic cause of AS (Table 1, Fig. 4) (147, 191, 247). Indeed, in some 
patients with AS, the genetic etiology is a point mutation or small deletion within the 
maternal Ube3a allele (3, 55, 147). Ube3a is selectively imprinted in the brain where 
expression occurs only from the maternal allele. Ube3a expression shows a stereo-
typical pattern of imprinting in most brain regions. For example, the maternal copy 
of Ube3a is highly expressed in hippocampal neurons and Purkinje cells of the cere-
bellum while the paternal copy in these regions is not (3, 236, 288). Heterozygous"

6 Conclusions and Perspectives 
While recent work has shed light on the role of the UPS at synapses, many basic 
questions remain. Even though a large number of protein components comprising the 
UPS have been identified, few have been studied in great detail at synapses. What 
determines the cellular distribution of UPS components at or near synapses? How are 
specific PSD components modulated by the UPS while not affecting structural integ-
rity? How does neuronal activity induce or limit the activity of UPS enzymes?

mice lacking maternal copies of Ube3a have decreased levels of Ube3a mRNA in 
these imprinted areas (130). These animals show defects in hippocampal LTP, con-
text-dependent learning, mild motor dysfunction, and a susceptibility to audiogeni-
cally induced seizures (130). 
While the genetic component of AS has been identified, the precise physiologi-
cal role of Ube3a function has not. Recent studies indicate that Ube3a regulates the 
activity of CamKIIα. Heterozygous mice lacking the maternal Ube3a allele (Ube3a 
m–/p+) show increased CaMKII phosphorylation on threonines 286 and 305 in hip-
pocampal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells (281, 293). As mentioned in previous 
sections, inhibitory phosphorylation of CaMKII is predicted to have a significant 
impact on synaptic plasticity and transmission (50, 281, 293). Synaptic dysfunction 
has been proposed as a general mechanism for neurodevelopmental disorders (317), 
which in the case of AS points to the involvement of the UPS. 
The emerging importance of protein turnover at synapses raises interesting ques-
tions about how neurons maintain their synaptic integrity. What determines synaptic 
protein turnover? What determines replacement of specific proteins and how are they 
replaced? How is protein degradation coupled to protein synthesis? How is synapse 
structure preserved? Are there degradation pathways for synaptic proteins relevant to 
synaptic plasticity similar to pathways postulated for synaptic protein synthesis? 
Also, a central theory of learning-based synaptic plasticity is that information is 
somehow stored by the composition of proteins at synapses. During ongoing activ-
ity-dependent protein turnover, how does the synapse sustain its molecular memory? 
While stimulating questions still remain, the multiple roles of the UPS in synapse 
development, signaling, and plasticity promise to offer many avenues for future 
study. Such efforts may be crucial in determining the link between normal synaptic 
physiology and dysfunction in neurological disorders involving aberrant protein 
degradation by the UPS."

1 Introduction 
Neurons, like all other eukaryotic cells, persistently alter their structure and/or func-
tion in response to extracellular signals through stimulus-induced changes in gene 
expression. While signal transduction pathways that serve to convey signals from the 
plasma membrane to the nucleus have been well characterized in non-neuronal cells, 
the transduction of signals from cell surface to nucleus poses a unique set of chal-
lenges in neurons because the distances between the sites receiving the signal and the 
nucleus can be extremely large (Fig. 1). The polarized morphology of nerve cells, 
with processes extending distances that can exceed the diameter of the cell body by 
orders of magnitude, has thus necessitated the development of specialized mecha-
nisms for retrograde transport of information received at the cell surface to the soma. 
 
Long-distance retrograde transport of signals is essential to the survival, growth 
and adaptability of neurons in the developing and the adult nervous system. During 
development, signals are transported from distal growth cones to the nucleus while 
neurons change their transcriptional profiles as axonal growth cones navigate and 
contact potential synaptic partners (41). In the adult brain, long-lasting forms of 
synaptic plasticity, including those that underlie learning and memory, depend on 
new transcription, indicating that stimuli received at synaptic sites are relayed to the 
nucleus to alter gene expression (2, 42). Retrograde signaling from distal sites also 
occurs in mature neurons following axonal injury, when injury-induced signals are 
transported to the nucleus to trigger transcription-dependent axonal regeneration (28, 
61). During each of these processes, signals received at distal compartments elicit 
transcriptional changes in the nucleus. While many studies have identified genes 
whose expression is altered by specific stimuli, the mechanisms whereby signals are 
transduced from the site of stimulation to the nucleus are just beginning to be eluci-
dated.

This chapter describes diversity in the structure and composition of synapses at the 
resolution of serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM). Section 1 
introduces the synapse. Section 2 describes the structure and composition of pre-
synaptic axons. Section 3 elucidates postsynaptic structure and composition. Section 4
discusses the impact of perisynaptic astroglial processes on synapses. Throughout 
all sections an effort is made to understand regularities in the relationships among 
these features that might contribute to the diversity in synapse size and number in 
systematic ways. 
A synapse has a presynaptic component, usually an axon but sometimes a den-
drite, and a postsynaptic component, usually part of a dendrite, cell soma, or axonal 
initial segment and occasionally an astroglial process. Perisynaptic astroglia repre-
sent a third component that occurs at some synapses. When perisynaptic astroglia are 
present, the structural complex has been referred to as a ‘tripartite synapse’ (45). Figure 1 
illustrates an electron micrograph of an ultrathin (50 nm) section through dendrites, 
axons, astroglial processes an synapses in the rat hippocampus. This picture was 
chosen to open this chapter because it nicely illustrates the diversity in the composi-
tion of even a tiny segment of the neuropil."

2 Presynaptic Structures and Composition 
Three dimensional reconstructions of individual presynaptic axons that pass through 
the complex hippocampal neuropil show the diversity in their local trajectories  
(Fig. 2a). A three-dimensional reconstruction of a hippocampal dendritic segment 
that is approximately 10 microns long illustrates the more than 10 fold variation in 
the dimensions of neighboring dendritic spines and synapses (Fig. 2b).

2.1 Presynaptic Active Zone 
A presynaptic axonal bouton contains vesicles with a variety of shapes and sizes. 
These vesicles contain excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters, neuromodulatory 
peptides, proteins required to concentrate neurotransmitters, and a variety of proteins 
involved in the vesicle cycle or that are destined for the presynaptic active zone (11). 
The presynaptic active zone is a specialized region variously described as ‘dense 
projections’, the ‘presynaptic grid’ or mini-active zones (34) where vesicles dock 
and become ready for release. Presynaptic vesicles are arranged along filaments that 
appear to be connected to the presynaptic active zone area (20, 25).  
2.2 Presynaptic Vesicles – Excitatory Synapses 
Excitatory presynaptic boutons contain clear round vesicles, approximately 35–50 
nm in diameter (Fig. 3). These vesicles usually contain the neurotransmitter gluta-
mate. Vesicles docked at the active zones are thought to be ready for release and 
vesicles located away from the membrane are thought to be in a pool that can be 
recruited for later release. One mechanism for neurotransmitter release involves pore 
formation and subsequent collapse of the presynaptic vesicle into the presynaptic 
membrane at the active zone with the contents being released into the synaptic cleft. 
Following exocytosis, synaptic vesicle membrane and protein constituents are recy-
cled through endocytosis (see chapter by McPherson et al., this volume). Endocyto-
sis typically occurs distant from the active zone, and is characterized morphologi-
cally by the presence of clathrin coated pits, vesicles and tubular compartments with 
coated buds that give rise to new synaptic vesicles locally in the presynaptic bouton 
(e.g. Fig. 3g). 
Sorting endosomal complexes also have a multivesicular body (similar to that 
shown in Fig. 12d for dendrites below) or a primary lysosome that transports pro-
teins and membrane bound for degradation away from the axonal bouton back to the 
soma. Presynaptic vesicles can also be rapidly recycled through a ‘kiss-and-run’ 
mechanism. During kiss-and-run, the vesicles release a portion of their contents 
through the pore, without collapse of the vesicular membrane. These vesicles are 
then rapidly retrieved at the site of release, and are immediately available for re-
release (33). At the ultrastructural level, many of the vesicles docked at the presynap-
tic active zone tend to be smaller, as though they had just released some of their 
contents at the time of fixation (19)."

2.3 Presynaptic Vesicles – Inhibitory Synapses 
Fig. 4. Inhibitory symmetric synapses in mature hippocampus with thin pre- and postsynaptic 
densities and pleiomorphic vesicles. (a) Two inhibitory synapses on the pyramidal cell bodies 
(open circles). (b) Symmetric synapse (open circle) with flattened vesicles (red arrows) and 
asymmetric synapse (closed circle) with thicker PSD and larger rounder presynaptic vesicles. 
These synapses are located directly on the dendritic shaft of a nonspiny interneuron in mature 
hippocampal area CA1. (Modified from (16)). 
Inhibitory presynaptic boutons contain smaller, pleiomorphic vesicles having both 
round and flattened shapes in aldehyde-fixed tissue (Fig. 4). The pleiomorphic vesicles 
usually contain the neurotransmitters GABA or glycine. Inhibitory synapses are most 
abundant at the neuronal soma (Fig. 4a) and proximal dendritic zones (see chapter by 
Arancibia-Carcamo, Triller and Kittler, this volume). In addition, inhibitory synapses 
can be interspersed among excitatory synapses (in the hippocampus about 1 inhibitory 
per 10–20 excitatory synapses) along a dendrite (Fig. 4b). Occasionally, inhibitory 
synapses are located at the axonal hillock, where activation of one or a small number of 
inhibitory synapses can regulate neuronal cell firing at their axons. In some brain re-
gions an inhibitory synapse occurs on the necks of some dendritic spines, whether they 
veto excitatory activation likely depends on their frequency and the specific circuit 
involved (12, 24, 46). Neurosecretory peptides and some neurotransmitters are local-
ized to the cytoplasm surrounding the pleiomorphic vesicles of inhibitory synapses, or 
in large dense core vesicles (~100 nm) (10, 43). If axons use these large secretory 
DCVs then more of them occur in each axonal bouton."

2.4 Presynaptic Small Dense Core Vesicles as Active Zone Transporters 
Small dense core vesicles (~80 nm) are distinct from large DCVs both in size and 
frequency (Fig. 5). Small DCVs are present in only about 20% of mature presynaptic 
axons, and when present, only 1–10 vesicles occur in a fully reconstructed axonal 
bouton. The outer membranes of small DCVs label with antibodies to proteins lo-
cated at the presynaptic active zone, such as piccolo and bassoon, and they are preva-
lent along axons in the developing nervous system; hence the small DCVs are 
thought to be a local source of new presynaptic active zones (1, 50) (see chapter by 
Shen and Garner, this volume). Recent work has shown that there are fewer small 
DCVs during rapid synapse formation in the mature hippocampus in further support 
of their role in local delivery of presynaptic active-zones (39).

2.5 Local Protein Synthesis in Presynaptic Boutons? 
Although polyribosomes are not a prominent component of presynaptic axonal  
boutons in the central nervous system, mRNAs have been localized to them (32). In 
squid giant axons, local protein synthesis machinery appears to derive from the en-
sheathing glia (9, 14). Detailed three-dimensional reconstructions will be required to 
learn whether isolated polyribosomes are directed into vertebrate presynaptic axonal 
boutons to allow for local protein synthesis, similar to that observed in dendritic 
spines (see below). 
2.6 Nonsynaptic, Single Synaptic and Multisynaptic Axonal Boutons 
Axonal boutons containing clear synaptic vesicles, mitochondria, dense core vesi-
cles, and multivesicular bodies occur both with and without postsynaptic partners 
(Fig. 6). In the mature hippocampus, about 96% of the vesicle-containing boutons 
have at least one postsynaptic partner. Single-synapse boutons predominate compris-
ing about 75% of all vesicle-containing axonal boutons. About 21% of vesicle-
containing boutons are multi-synaptic while about 4% are non-synaptic boutons in 
the mature hippocampus (36, 37). There are more multisynaptic boutons when rapid 
synaptogenesis occurs in the hippocampus, such as that which occurs during the 
estrus cycle (49) or following the preparation of mature hippocampal slices under 
ice-cold conditions (22, 23, 31). Multisynaptic dendritic spines, receiving input from 
more than one presynaptic axon occur relatively frequently during development and 
under conditions of synaptogenesis in the mature hippocampus. The axonal segment 
in Fig. 6c was from a hippocampal slice that had been prepared under ice-cold dis-
section conditions, which induces new synapses. These findings suggest that rapid 
synaptogenesis in the mature hippocampus does not require de novo formation of 
presynaptic axons. It is not known whether the nonsynaptic boutons also constitute a 
source of available presynaptic boutons to accommodate rapid synaptogenesis, if 
they represent vesicle clusters in transit between presynaptic varicosities, or if thery 
are sites of recent synapse loss. Similarly, presynaptic axonal boutons vary in struc-
ture along the axons from other brain regions such as cerebellar cortex (Fig. 7, (48)). 
Parallel fiber axons synapse with dendritic spines of Purkinje cell spiny branchlets 
(Fig. 7a–c; see also Figs. 8d, 11c and f below for further discussion of these postsy-
naptic spines). The climbing fiber axons that synapse along the proximal dendrite of 
the Purkinje cells have much larger, more irregularly shaped boutons (Fig. 7d) than 
parallel fiber axons."

3 Postsynaptic Structure and Composition 
3.1 Diversity in Postsynaptic Dendritic Spine Structure 
Postsynaptic structure is highly diverse among synapses on the same dendrite and 
across different cell types in the brain. For example, neighboring dendritic spines on 
a single hippocampal dendritic segment can vary more than 10 fold in their dimen-
sions (e.g. Figs. 2b, 11d). Large highly branched dendritic spines are the postsynaptic 
partners of mossy fibers in the hippocampal area CA3 (Fig. 8a–c). The dendritic 
spines occurring along the spiny branchlets of cerebellar Purkinje cells vary widely 
in their size, yet they are more uniformly club-shaped (Fig. 8d). These cerebellar 
spines can be branched; however, the head of each branch on the spine is also club 
shaped (for more examples see (17)). Similarly, dendritic spines distributed along the 
same presynaptic axon vary greatly in their dimensions (Fig. 6). The size of the den-
dritic spine and its synapse correlates nearly perfectly with the number of vesicles in 
the presynaptic bouton for all brain regions tested so far (Fig. 9). Thus, it is of great 
interest to understand the rules that govern local changes in synaptic structure and 
how they are coordinated between the pre- and postsynaptic structures. One strategy 
has been to investigate the impact of altering the molecular composition of neurons 
to determine the impact on dendritic spine structure (reviewed in (4, 42)). Another 
strategy has been to compare the composition of subcellular organelles among den-
dritic spines and synapses of differing morphologies, during different stages of de-
velopment, and during synaptic plasticity. Our focus in this chapter is on this second 
strategy."

Fig. 9. Strong correlation between PSD area, spine volume, and t number of presynaptic vesi-
cles. This dataset is from hippocampal area CA1, but these relationships hold true across all 
brain regions evaluated so far, including synapses in hippocampal area CA3, cerebellar cortex, 
striatum, and neocortex. (Adapted from (18, 26)). 
The postsynaptic density (PSD) contains a host of important receptors, scaffolding 
proteins, and signaling complexes that vary from synapse to synapse (21). The diver-
sity in molecular composition from synapse to synapse is great, with hundreds of 
different proteins having been identified in the PSD. In aldehyde-fixed tissue, excita-
tory synapses are characterized by a thick PSD relative to the thinner presynaptic 
active zone, and hence are called ‘asymmetric synapses’ (Figs. 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 
14, see also (15, 30)). Inhibitory synapses usually have equally thin PSDs and pre-
synaptic active zones and hence are referred to as ‘symmetric synapses’ (Fig. 4). 
These relationships are highly diverse and the degree of pre- and postsynaptic thick-
ening varies greatly even among excitatory or inhibitory synapses in the same brain 
region ((6), http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu/anatomy/chemical/colh.htm). Importantly, 
PSD thickness is also sensitive to experimental manipulations that are known to 
impact the abundance of PSD molecules, such as the calcium calmodulin dependent 
protein kinase type II (CaMKII), which are highly enriched in the PSD (28). 
The reconstructed surface area of the PSD correlates nearly perfectly with the 
volume and surface area of the spine head (Fig. 9, (18, 26)). The PSD area and spine 
head volume also correlate nearly perfectly with the total number of presynaptic 
vesicles and the number of vesicles docked at the presynaptic active zone (18, 19, 26, 
35). These observations suggest a strong structure-function relationship between 
dendritic spines and their presynaptic axons. Exactly how this important relationship 
is achieved and maintained during development and synaptic plasticity is not known."

3.3 Polyribosomes – Local Protein Synthesis in Dendrites and Spines 
Polyribosomes occur in some, but certainly not all dendritic spines (41). They are 
sites where translation could have been occurring at the time of tissue fixation. Ri-
bosomes are identified in dendrites and spines as 10–25 nm electron dense spheres 
surrounded by a gray halo; and polyribosomes are identified in ssTEM as having at 
least 3 ribosomes (Fig. 10ab). Free polyribosomes synthesize cytoplasmic proteins, 
like those in the PSD and have been found to increase in frequency during plasticity 
such as LTP (27). Bound polyribosomes are associated with endoplasmic reticulum 
and synthesize integral proteins, such as receptors. Occasionally polyribosomes have 
been detected in the vicinity of a spine apparatus (Fig. 10b, 11a). Quantitative 
ssTEM is required to ascertain the relative frequencies of free and bound polyri-
bosomes in spines and at other synapse types in the developing and mature brain and 
during plasticity such as learning and memory which requires local protein synthesis.

3.4 Diversity in Composition of Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum  
and Endosomal Compartments in Dendrites and Spines 
Some dendritic spines contain smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), which func-
tions as an internal calcium store. In the hippocampus, only about 15% of all spines 
contain SER, and typically only the largest spines contain SER (40). In contrast, 
nearly all cerebellar dendritic spines contain SER (17). The spine apparatus is an 
enigmatic organelle variously thought to be involved in the regulation of calcium, 
synthesis of proteins, and post-translational modification of proteins like the Golgi 
apparatus (Fig. 11a–d). It contains SER-like membranes arranged in laminae sepa-
rated by dense-staining bars that contain the actin-binding protein synaptopodin 
which is necessary for maintaining its laminar structure and for positioning it into 
spines (13). Only large hippocampal and cortical spines contain a spine apparatus; in 
contrast the SER of cerebellar spines forms a reticular membranous network without 
the dense-staining laminations found in the spine apparatus (Fig. 11ef). Total spine 
volume is well-correlated with the volume of SER, suggesting a functional role in 
maintaining ionic balance of cerebellar spines. The presence or absence of SER 
might also account for the relative stability of cerebellar spines, and plasticity among 
hippocampal spines (3).  
There are many other membrane-bound organelles present in dendrites and 
spines. Many of these organelles are endosomes as revealed by tracking internalized 
gold particles conjugated with bovine serum albumin that were injected into the 
extracellular space of a PN21 hippocampal slice (7). The presence of gold particles 
in the intracellular organelles unambiguously identifies them as endosomal or recy-
cling compartments inside dendrites and spines (Fig. 12a–d). In contrast, the SER is 
a continuous membrane-bound reticulum that is easily distinguished upon recon-
struction from the discrete tubules and vesicles of endosomal compartments (Fig. 12e)."

Quantitative work shows that about 50 percent of normal hippocampal dendritic 
spines from perfusion fixed brain contain no membrane bound organelles; and a 
distinction among spines that contain the different types of organelles (Fig. 13a). 
Interestingly, the amount of SER also varies along the shaft of the parent dendritic 
shaft (Fig. 13b). Recent work shows endosomal compartments to be dynamically 
regulated during synaptic plasticity (29). It will be interesting to learn whether the 
presence or absence of SER is also dynamically regulated in spines during synaptic 
plasticity.

4 Perisynaptic Astroglial Processes 
In the cerebellum, nearly all synapses are enveloped by perisynaptic astroglial proc-
esses (Fig. 14ab). Astroglial processes are identified by their light cytoplasm and the 
presence of dark glycogen granules and astrocytic fibrils in larger processes. They 
end in thin or flattened processes that easily interdigitate among axons and dendrites 
throughout the brain. In contrast, less than 50% of neocortical and hippocampal 
dendritic spine synapses have astroglial processes at their perimeters (Fig. 14cd).

the synaptic cleft of nearly all synapses made by (a) climbing fibers or (b) parallel fibers. In 
contrast, only about half of all hippocampal synapses have astroglial processes at the cleft, 
even between neighboring synapses (e.g. s1Æ s2 Red arrow; s3 has no perisynaptic astroglia 
at the presynaptic bouton, the postsynaptic spine, or the perisynaptic cleft region. Scale bar = 1

Summary 
In this chapter I have described the highly diverse structure and composition of pre-
synaptic axons, postsynaptic spines and dendrites, and perisynaptic astroglial proc-
esses. Postsynaptic size is proportional to presynaptic vesicle content and larger 
synaptic dendritic spines contain more of the subcellular organelles needed to re-
model and sustain them. Perisynaptic astroglial processes also appear to be key play-
ers in determining synapse size. Although synapse structure may appear static in 
electron micrographs, it is highly dynamic, undergoing dramatic changes in gross 
morphology, as well as, the positioning of subcellular organelles during basic synap-
tic transmission and in response to conditions that elicit changes in synapse function 
or ‘synaptic plasticity’. Similarly, the structure and composition of synapses can vary 
across brain regions, and change dynamically during development, maturation, nor-
mal aging, neurological disorders and trauma. Careful consideration of this structural 
diversity and plasticity is leading to new understanding about synapse formation, 
growth, maintenance and elimination. 
 
This differential arrangement of perisynaptic astroglia suggests that some syn-
apses are highly regulated and supported by this important partner in the tripartite 
synapse, whereas other synapses are either more selective, unable to attract astroglial 
processes, or actively repel them (44). Exactly how this relationship is regulated by 
local synaptic plasticity remains to be determined, however, attraction to high concen-
trations of extracellular glutamate is a likely candidate mechanism (8). In the mature 
hippocampus, those synapses that have a perisynaptic astroglial process at its perime-
ter, are on average significantly larger than synapses without (47). Importantly, size is 
associated with the presence of an astroglial process juxtaposed to the postsynaptic 
spine and/or synaptic cleft; not the degree to which the astroglial process surrounds 
the synapse (Fig. 14de). In fact, very large hippocampal synapses might have only a 
small fraction of their perimeters surrounded by an astroglial process (compare Fig. 
14de). These arrangements suggest that the perisynaptic astroglial processes do more 
than simply delineate boundaries between synapses to prevent spillover of neuro-
transmitter and crosstalk and are likely crucial partners in sustaining synapses (2). 
One intriguing possibility, small, new, relatively unstable synapses in hippocampus or 
cortex, share the extracellular products released during synaptic transmission from 
other synapses, until they grow big enough to attract their own stabilizing astroglial 
processes (see chapter by Eroglu, Barres and Stevens, this volume).

1 Introduction 
Exocytotic release of glutamate from preformed synaptic vesicles confers great 
speed on synaptic signaling, but also requires mechanisms to maintain the pool of 
available synaptic vesicles and remove glutamate from the extracellular space. Since 
the axon terminal is in general located at a great distance from the cell body, 
synapses rely on the local recycling of both synaptic vesicle membrane and their 
neurotransmitter contents. In this review, we address recycling of the excitatory 
transmitter glutamate, focusing on transport activities that operate at the plasma 
membrane and the synaptic vesicle, and the role that these transporters play in 
determining the amplitude and time course of synaptic responses. 
2 Glutamate Transport into Synaptic Vesicles and the Presynaptic 
Regulation of Quantal Size 
Although analysis of the neuromuscular junction originally suggested that the 
response to release of a single vesicle filled with neurotransmitter is fixed, and hence 
represents the elemental “quantum” of synaptic transmission (109), considerable 
work has now shown that quantal size can change as a function of activity, 
contributing to such forms of plasticity as long-term potentiation (124). Nonetheless, 
the locus for this regulation is postsynaptic, and involves changes in receptor number 
or sensitivity. More recently, it has become clear that changes in quantal size can 
also reflect presynaptic changes in vesicle filling. 
 
It has long been appreciated that changes in the amount of neuromodulator 
released per vesicle can have profound consequences for the activation of receptors 
at a distance from the release site. Many G protein-coupled receptors have a 
relatively high affinity for their peptide and monoamine ligands, but the small

A central question, given the significant distances that exist between distal com-
partments and the soma in neurons, is how retrograde signaling can occur in a man-
ner in which the transcriptional response is temporally coupled to the stimulus. 
Nerve cells are specialized for rapid signaling between compartments (Fig. 2). 
Thus, depolarization at growth cones or synapses can travel by passive electrotonic"

Fig. 2. Neurons possess several cell biological mechanisms for transmitting signals from distal 
compartments in axons (shown in green) and dendrites (shown in blue) to the nucleus (shown 
in pink). These include (1) rapid electrochemical signaling, in which action potentials (in 
axons) or dendritic spikes (in dendrites) rapidly propagate from distal sites to the soma where 
they open voltage-gated calcium channels. The resulting elevation of somatic calcium concen-
trations triggers calcium-dependent changes in gene expression in the nucleus. (2) Synaptic 
signals can also cause a release of calcium stored in the ER (represented by the yellow line), 
leading to regenerative calcium waves mediated by inositol triphosphate and ryanodine recep-
tors. Since the ER extends into axons and dendrites and is continuous with the nuclear mem-
brane, the regenerative calcium wave can be rapidly propagated to the nucleus, where they 
initiate calcium-dependent changes in gene expression. (3) Signals can be actively transported 
from synapses along cytoskeletal components (black line) by molecular motors (red). These 
signals can consist of soluble proteins or signaling endosomes. In the nucleus, these signals 
function to alter transcription. (4) Both second messengers and soluble proteins can passively 
diffuse from distal compartments toward the cell body and into the nucleus."

spread, action potentials or calcium spikes to the cell soma, where the opening of 
voltage-gated calcium channels in the plasma membrane rapidly transmits signals to 
the nucleus (8, 18, 24, 66, 79, 80). Rapid signaling can also occur by regenerative 
calcium waves mediated by inositol triphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) and ryanodine 
receptors (RYRs) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is continuous with the 
nuclear envelope yet extends into distal neuronal processes (12). Slower retrograde 
signaling pathways include the passive or active transport of signaling molecules 
2 Rapid Synapse-Nucleus Signaling 
2.1 Signaling Mediated by Action Potentials 
Electrochemical signaling allows neurons to rapidly deliver signals from distal sites 
to the nucleus. Local depolarization of the synaptic terminal, mediated by ligand-
gated ion channels, can activate voltage-gated ion channels. The influx of both so-
dium and calcium ions further depolarizes the membrane, and if this depolarization 
reaches threshold at the axon hillock, it triggers action potentials, which depolarize 
the soma and axon (and potentially into dendrites via backpropagating action poten-
tials) (10). Synaptic potentials generated at distal dendritic sites can also be rapidly 
conveyed to the cell soma via forward-propagating dendritic spikes (80). Once they 
reach the soma, action potentials and dendritic spikes both result in the opening of 
voltage-gated calcium channels, triggering a large increase in intracellular calcium. 
The increase in somatic calcium can in turn activate calcium-sensitive signaling 
cascades that function to alter gene expression in the nucleus. Calcium-sensitive 
signaling molecules can be activated directly within the nucleus via increases in 
nuclear calcium concentrations, or they can be activated in the somatic cytoplasm 
and then imported into the nucleus. These signaling molecules activate transcription 
factors and thereby couple neuronal activity to changes in gene expression (1, 8). 
Whether calcium-dependent signaling cascades are directly activated in the nu-
cleus or in the somatic cytoplasm, action potential or spike-mediated signaling from 
synapse to nucleus is extremely rapid. Electrochemical signals propagate along the 
length of the neuron within milliseconds. The propagation of calcium transients to 
the nucleus occurs within seconds, and the transport of signaling molecules (e.g. 
activated kinases) from somatic cytoplasm to the nucleus occurs within minutes. As 
such, transcriptional changes that result from action potentials or dendritic spikes 
could occur very quickly (within minutes) after a signal is received at the synapse.  
through the axon and dendrite to the cell body (58) and the transport of signals from 
distal compartments in the form of signaling endosomes (22, 33, 36). It is likely that 
neurons use a combination of these various signaling mechanisms to transmit infor-
mation to the nucleus. In this manner, distinct stimuli can recruit specific retrograde 
signaling pathways, and these in turn trigger distinct changes in transcriptional pro-
files that are initiated and persist over various time domains. In this chapter, we 
introduce each of the various cell biological pathways neurons can use to convey 
information received at distal sites to the nucleus."

An additional advantage of electrochemical signaling between synapse and nucleus 
is that an influx of calcium occurs in the cell body. This increases the likelihood that 
a calcium-dependent intracellular signal will be efficiently conveyed to the nucleus, 
and not be diminished as it travels the entire length of the dendrite. As a result, the 
amount of signal that reaches the nucleus will be significantly greater than it would 
be if the signal were transported directly from the synapse. 
Two other features of signaling to the nucleus via action potentials should be 
considered. First, signaling by action potentials spreads throughout the cell, and 
thereby can activate signaling cascades throughout the cell. As such, it has been 
proposed that action potentials are not “synapse to nucleus” signals, but rather 
global, cell-wide signals initiated by synaptic stimulation (1). Presumably, in order to 
mediate signaling underlying synapse-specific changes in function, the products of 
gene expression induced by action potentials must combine with local synaptic tags 
that are generated by the initial synaptic stimulation (20, 51). Synaptic tags are local-
ized changes that persist at synapses following stimulation and that function together 
with the products of gene expression to produce persistent changes in synaptic struc-
ture and function. In fact, any transcriptional process should be considered to be a 
“global,” cell-wide change, and likely needs to combine with a synaptic tag to have 
synapse-specific effects. A second consideration about electrochemical signaling is 
that to function as a mechanism mediating activity-dependent changes in gene ex-
pression, it is likely that a threshold number of action potentials or spikes occur 
within a certain time window in order to activate transcriptional changes, with dis-
tinct patterns of activity triggering differential patterns of transcription. 
2.2 Signaling Via the Endoplasmic Reticulum 
Rapid calcium-dependent signaling from synapse to nucleus can also occur via the 
ER, a major internal store of calcium. In neurons, the ER is continuous with the 
nuclear membrane and extends into both axons and dendrites. Within the axon, soma 
and initial dendritic segment, electron microscopy studies reveal that the ER can 
come into close proximity to the plasma membrane (for review see (12)). Within the 
dendrite, the ER extends into spines where it forms the spine apparatus (71). 
The ER contains two types of receptors that function to release calcium from the 
ER lumen into the cytosol: InsP3Rs (19) and RYRs (84). InsP3Rs are found through-
out the ER, including in synapses and spines as well as in regions where the ER is in 
close proximity to the plasma membrane. InsP3Rs are activated by inositol triphos-
phate (IP3), a second messenger generated by activation of G-protein coupled recep-
tors that are coupled to phospholipase C, such as metabotropic glutamate receptors at 
excitatory synapses. Their activity is critically modulated by cytosolic calcium, such 
that calcium release is significantly potentiated by increased concentrations of cyto-
solic calcium. This sensitivity to calcium allows InsP3Rs to function as calcium-
induced calcium release (CICR) channels.  Notably, recent studies have shown that 
InsP3Rs can also be activated in the absence of IP3, through the binding of a family of 
calcium binding proteins (77, 83).  While RYRs are found primarily in the cell body, 
they are also present at more distal sites and can colocalize with InsP3Rs. RYRs are 
activated when cytosolic calcium concentrations are between 1-10 μM; binding of"

calcium to the RYR promotes release of calcium from the ER lumen into the cytosol 
(84). As such, RYRs also function as CICR channels. 
The sensitivity of both InsP3Rs and RYRs to calcium underlies their ability to 
generate regenerative calcium waves. Thus, calcium released from the internal stores 
in the ER is capable of activating neighboring InsP3Rs or RYRs, allowing the signal 
to continue along the ER. Because the ER can extend to the most distal sites in axons 
and dendrites, yet is connected with the nuclear envelope, activation of neighboring 
receptors provides a means for a continuous signal to be rapidly propagated all the 
way to the nucleus. Receptors located at synapses and/or near the plasma membrane 
are activated by calcium influx through plasma membrane receptors; calcium re-
leased from internal stores then promotes propagation of a calcium wave from the 
initial site of activation through the neuronal process, to the nuclear envelope (9, 12, 
56, 74). Release of calcium from the ER amplifies the effects of calcium influx 
through plasma membrane calcium channels. Michael Berridge (12) has thus pro-
posed that the ER acts as a “neuron-within-a-neuron.” While the outer membrane 
responds quickly to external stimuli through the opening of ligand-gated ion chan-
nels and activation of G protein-coupled receptors, the ER responds to the internal 
signals generated in response to external stimuli. 
The influx of extracellular calcium through ion channels and calcium released 
from intracellular stores in the ER both cause an increase in calcium concentrations 
in the cell body. The increases in somatic calcium concentrations can in turn activate 
calcium-dependent signaling cascades in the somatic cytoplasm and/or in the nu-
cleus, both of which can ultimately trigger calcium-dependent changes in gene ex-
pression. While signaling from synapse to nucleus via regenerative calcium waves in 
the ER is somewhat slower than electrochemical signals, since it depends on both 
metabotropic and ionotropic receptors, it is nonetheless a rapid mechanism of con-
veying signals from distal sites to the soma. Further, the regenerative nature of the 
calcium waves in the ER indicates that the signal is not diminished as it travels from 
the site of initiation to the soma. 
3 Physical Translocation of Signaling Molecules from Distal 
Compartments to the Nucleus 
The physical translocation of molecules through the axon or dendrite to the cell soma 
provides another mechanism whereby neurons can signal from distal compartments 
to the nucleus. This type of signaling includes the retrograde transport of specialized 
organelles known as signaling endosomes as well as transport of soluble molecules 
via either passive or active diffusion. Transport of signals via these pathways is 
much slower than signaling by action potentials or by regenerative calcium waves in 
the ER. As a result, the coupling between stimulation at a distal site and the tran-
scriptional response is slower and may persist over a longer time period. Notably, 
unlike nuclear signaling by action potentials or regenerative calcium waves in the 
ER, the physical translocation of molecules from distal sites to the nucleus does not 
necessarily depend on calcium. This thus provides a mechanism whereby stimuli that 
do not cause depolarization or calcium influx (e.g. some modulatory inputs or 
growth factors) can nonetheless elicit changes in gene expression."

Before considering specific aspects of retrograde transport via signaling en-
dosomes or active nuclear import pathways, it is useful to briefly discuss the role of 
the cytoskeleton and of motor proteins in the retrograde transport of molecules to the 
neuronal soma. The neuronal cytoskeleton includes microtubules, actin and interme-
diate filaments. In addition to their structural roles in neurons, microtubules and actin 
filaments serve as tracks for the directed movements of molecules within neuronal 
processes (27, 47). Microtubules are particularly relevant to the transport of signals 
from distal synapses to the soma because they provide long-range tracks for trans-
port. In axons, microtubules are uniformly oriented with the plus ends at the synapse 
and minus ends at the cell body. In dendrites, the polarity of microtubules with re-
spect to the cell body is mixed. Active transport along microtubules is mediated by 
molecular motors, of which there are two major classes: kinesin motor proteins, 
which generally transport from minus to plus ends of microtubules, and dynein mo-
tor proteins, which transport from plus to minus ends of microtubules. In axons, 
anterograde transport from the cell body to the synapse thus occurs via plus-end-
directed kinesins and retrograde transport from the terminals to the soma occurs via 
dynein, and possibly minus-end-directed kinesins. The directionality of motor-
protein driven transport is less clear in dendrites because of the mixed polarity of 
microtubules, although microtubules in distal dendrites have their plus ends oriented 
distally indicating that dynein is required for retrograde transport of cargoes from 
these sites (68). 
A central question in the field of molecular motors concerns the specificity and 
regulation of motor-cargo binding (27). This question is relevant to signaling from 
synapse to nucleus in neurons since the regulated binding of cargoes to specific mo-
tors will have obvious effects on the directionality of transport in axons and/or den-
drites. Cargo binding to kinesins, either directly or through adaptor or scaffolding 
proteins relieves auto-inhibition of the N-terminal tail of the motor protein by C-
terminal sequences, allowing the cargo-containing kinesin to travel along micro-
tubules. Cargo binding to dynein is frequently mediated by a large dynein-binding 
protein called dynactin (34). Recent studies have indicated that post-translational 
modifications of tubulin can also influence transport in neurons by modulating the 
association of motor proteins with microtubules (14). Specifically, acetylation of 
tubulin has been shown to increase the association of kinesin-1 to microtubules and 
the transport of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting proteins (JIPs, a family of adap-
tor proteins for kinesin cargoes) into distal neurites (64), and to increase the traffick-
ing of BDNF-containing vesicles along microtubules in neurons (17). Thus, transport 
along microtubules in neuronal processes may be regulated by the initial binding of 
cargoes to molecular motors and by the binding of molecular motors to microtubules. 
The latter may be specifically regulated by post-translational modifications of tubu-
lin, which include acetylation, tyrosination and polyglutamylation (76). 
3.1 Retrograde Signaling by Signaling Endosomes 
One way of transmitting information received at distal compartments to the soma is 
via the signaling endosome pathway (22, 33, 36). In this pathway, ligand-bound 
receptors are internalized and transported back to the cell body in signaling"

endosomes, functioning as activated receptors as they travel to the soma. This proc-
ess has been best characterized in neurons in terms of the binding of nerve growth 
factor (NGF) to the tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA at the axon terminal. Binding of 
NGF to TrkA receptors causes dimerization of the receptor and autophosphorylation 
of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain. The binding of the ligand 
and subsequent phosphorylation leads to an “activated” ligand-receptor complex. 
This entire complex can be internalized through an endocytotic pathway that travels 
along microtubules in a dynein-dependent manner. The ligand-receptor complex 
serves as the message that is transported from the nerve terminal to the soma in a 
“signaling endosome.” In the soma, the ligand-bound receptor activates signaling 
cascades that are then transmitted into the nucleus where they can alter transcription. 
A proposed advantage of the signaling endosome pathway in neurons is that it is 
“regenerative,” in the sense that the ligand remains bound to the receptor and thus 
continuously recruits signaling cascades as it travels through the axon to the nucleus 
(37). Many of the experiments elucidating the signaling endosome pathway have 
been in compartmentalized chambers in which the cell bodies of sympathetic neurons 
are separated from their axons by barriers, a powerful system that allows manipulation 
and discrimination of trafficking in distal axons from events in cell bodies (15). 
While there is considerable evidence for an endosome-mediated transport process 
for transmitting neurotrophic signaling from the nerve terminal to the nucleus, there 
are alternative hypotheses for how activation of distal Trk receptors transmits infor-
mation to the nucleus. One such alternative idea is that activation of a Trk receptor 
initiates a ligand-independent cascade of phosphorylation of Trk receptors down the 
length of the axon (67). A second possibility is that activation of Trk receptors at the 
nerve terminal leads to an increase in intracellular calcium (11), which as discussed 
above, can be rapidly propagated to the nucleus. 
3.2 Translocation of Soluble Molecules Through the Process  
to the Cell Soma 
Another mechanism of signaling from distal compartments to the nucleus is via the 
transport of soluble proteins through the neuronal process to the cell soma. This 
transport could occur by passive diffusion or by active transport. Several theoretical 
studies have indicated that passive diffusion of proteins through the cytoplasmic 
milieu is not efficient for long-distance signaling (35), arguing that active, facilitated 
transport of proteins is required for efficient signaling from synapse to soma. De-
pending on the size of the soluble molecule, once it reaches the soma, it may either 
diffuse through the nuclear membrane (passive transport) or use specialized transport 
systems and energy-dependent processes (active transport) to enter the nucleus. 
 
The nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by two membranes, forming the 
nuclear envelope. The outer membrane is continuous with the ER, and the space 
between the inner and outer membranes is continuous with the lumen of the ER. The 
nuclear envelope is perforated with nuclear pores, through which molecules can pass 
between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Nuclear pores are formed by structures 
known as nuclear pore complexes, octagonally-shaped channels, approximately 9 nm 
in diameter, and composed of more than 100 different proteins called nucleoporins"
307,"===== Page 9 =====

(48). The size of the channel formed by the nuclear pore complex limits the size of 
molecules that can readily diffuse through the nuclear pore. Small molecules, such as 
ions and second messengers can rapidly diffuse through the pore; larger molecules, 
including proteins up to approximately 40 kDa in size, can also diffuse through the 
pore, although at a much slower rate; and proteins greater than approximately 40–60 
kDa in size must be transported through the pore by facilitated, active nuclear im-
port. 
3.3 The Active Nuclear Import Pathway 
Proteins greater than 40-60 kDa, as well as some smaller proteins, are transported 
into the nucleus through active, energy-dependent nuclear import, facilitated by one 
of a family of nuclear transport receptors called importins (or karyopherins). The 
largest class of nuclear transporters is the importin βs (32), which bind directly to 
their cargoes and to the nucleoporins. More than 20 members of the importin β su-
perfamily have been identified in humans, each of which transports a unique set of 
cargo proteins (38). In the classical nuclear import pathway, importin β1 binds its 
cargo through one of a family of nuclear import adaptors called importin αs. Six 
importin αs have been identified in humans, and five in mice (38). 
 
Importin-mediated transport functions to carry any protein larger than ~40-60 kD 
from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. It thus is involved in the nuclear import of sig-
naling proteins activated by calcium transients in the somatic cytoplasm. Recent 
studies have indicated that importin-mediated transport may additionally play a spe-
cialized role in neurons in which it also functions to transport signals from distal 
compartments to the nucleus (58, 61). Importins have been localized to distal axons 
and dendrites of a variety of types of neurons, including Aplysia sensory and motor 
neurons, rodent hippocampal neurons, and rodent sensory neurons (29, 73). In rodent 
Cargo proteins are recognized by importins through a short amino acid sequence 
known as a nuclear localization signal (NLS). The classical NLS, first described for 
the large-T antigen of SV40, is a short stretch of basic amino acids, PKKKRKV (40). 
Another type of classical NLS is bipartite, with two stretches of basic amino acids 
separated by a short linker of nonbasic amino acids (the prototype being the NLS of 
nucleoplasmin, KRPAATKKKAGQAKKKK) (65). Although putative NLSs can be 
inferred from primary sequence data, they are defined empirically either by fusing 
the sequence to a non-nuclear protein (which is then transported into the nucleus) or 
by mutational analysis. The part of importin α that binds to importin β1 is an NLS-
like domain in the N-terminus. In the absence of importin β1, this NLS-like domain 
is autoinhibitory and masks the NLS-binding portion of importin α. Thus, with im-
portin β1 bound, the affinity of importin α for its cargo increases from the micromo-
lar to the nanomolar range. The high affinity cargo-importin α-importin β1 complex 
is transported through the nuclear pore in an energy-dependent process in a mecha-
nism that is not entirely understood. Inside the nucleus, the complex is disassembled 
when the small GTP-binding protein Ran, in its GTP-bound form, binds to importin 
β1, dissociating it from importin α and the NLS-bearing proteins. Importin α and 
importin β1 then shuttle back into the cytoplasm, leaving the cargo in the nucleus."

motor neurons, importin-mediated transport from sites of injury to the nucleus has 
been shown to be required for transcription-dependent phases of regeneration follow-
ing axonal crush injury (29). In rodent hippocampal and Aplysia sensory neurons, 
importins have been shown to translocate from distal sites to the nucleus during 
transcription-dependent forms of learning-related synaptic plasticity, and in Aplysia 
neurons, blockade of active nuclear import has been shown to block long-term plas-
ticity (73). 
 
One important consideration regarding importin-mediated transport from synapse 
to nucleus has is that there is no amplification of the signal from the site of initiation 
to the nucleus. Unlike action potentials or retrograde calcium signals, the number of 
molecules being transmitted is limited by the amount of that material at the stimu-
lated synapse. Adams and Dudek (1) have referred to this as a problem of 
stoichiometry, in which the small amount of protein transported from stimulated 
synapses has to compete with a large amount of protein in the nucleus, and is thus 
unlikely to make significant contributions to transcriptional change. Essentially, this 
is a signal to noise problem. This problem is less significant if the signal is an en-
zyme, since the enzymatic activity serves to amplify the signal. Additionally, it is not 
clear whether a threshold number of transcription factors is required to trigger sig-
nificant changes in transcription and gene expression. 
4 Examples of Signaling Between Distal Compartments  
and the Nucleus in Neurons 
Retrograde signaling is required for the growth, survival and adaptability of neurons 
throughout development and adult life. Insights into the cell biological pathways 
utilized by neurons to mediate long-distance transport to the soma have emerged 
 
In Aplysia neurons, Richard Ambron and colleagues (5) found that when a large 
protein (human serum albumin) was coupled to the SV40 NLS and microinjected 
into a distal growth cone, it translocated to the nucleus in a manner that required an 
intact microtubule network. These studies indicated both that the nuclear import 
machinery (importins) was present in distal growth cones and that transport of im-
portins and their cargoes occurred along microtubules. More recently, Hanz et al. 
described an interaction between importin α and dynein motor proteins in the motor 
neuron axon (29). In a second study, they found that importin β1 interacts with 
vimentin in motor neurons, and that vimentin serves to couple importin β1 bound to 
a cargo (in this case, mitogen-activated protein kinase 42/44) to the dynein motor 
protein complex. While the details of this pathway have not been elucidated, these 
results are consistent with the idea that importins retrogradely transport their protein 
cargoes from distal sites to the soma along microtubule tracks in axons and den-
drites, in a dynein-motor protein-dependent manner. Interestingly, Giri et al. (23) 
recently found that the intracellular domain of the ErbB2 tyrosine kinase receptor 
interacts with importin β1, and that this interaction is required for its transport into 
the soma and signaling to the nucleus. Since this interaction occurred when ErbB2 
was intact, it suggests that importins may also be involved in the retrograde transport 
of signaling endosomes."

from studies in a variety of systems. Together, these studies indicate that each of the 
various pathways outlined above are used to transduce signals received at distal 
compartments to the nucleus in response to distinct stimuli. 
4.1 Retrograde Transport of Signals from Distal Compartments  
to the Nucleus During Development of the Synapse 
A number of studies have indicated that synaptogenesis and synapse differentiation 
are accompanied by transcriptional changes pre- and post-synaptically (reviewed in 
(41)). Although the signaling cascades and factors that initiate transcriptional 
changes during synapse formation are not well understood, a number of studies have 
begun to elucidate potential candidates. These include signaling by neurotrophins as 
well the Wingless-Int (wnt) and Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) signaling 
pathways. In each of these pathways, signaling from synapse to nucleus appears to 
occur via signaling endosomes. 
Studies of the role of target-derived growth factors in promoting transcriptional 
changes in the nuclei of innervating neurons have provided the bulk of evidence for 
the signaling endosome pathway outlined above (22, 33, 36). Briefly, growth factors 
bind to their cognate Trk receptors and are internalized in endosomes that are retro-
gradely transported the distance of the axon to the cell soma. In the cell body, the 
ligand-bound Trk receptors retain their catalytic activity, and signal to downstream 
signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phos-
photidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3 kinase) and phospholipase C-γ pathways. The end 
result is the transduction of target-derived signals (initially received at great dis-
tances from the soma) to the nucleus where they alter transcription. 
Budnik and colleagues have shown in flies that wingless is secreted from pre-
synaptic terminals during synaptogenesis and binds to the Drosophila frizzled2 re-
ceptor (dFrizzled2). dFrizzled2 is internalized into endosomes in the presynaptic 
terminal and travels back, in a dynein-dependent manner, to the soma of the postsy-
naptic cell, where the cytoplasmic tail is cleaved and then translocated into the nu-
cleus where it may regulate transcription (52).Interestingly, the retrograde transport 
of dFrizzled2 was also shown to depend on Drosophila glutamate receptor interact-
ing protein (dGRIP), a synaptically localized PDZ-domain containing protein (7). 
Studies of synapse formation at the neuromuscular junction of Drosophila have 
also revealed that a TGFβ protein called Gbb is released from the muscle and binds 
to a TGFβ receptor (53, 54, 63). Ligand binding to this receptor in turn leads to 
phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic protein mammalian mothers against decapenta-
plegic, SMAD, which in turn associates with a co-SMAD protein to translocate into 
the nucleus and regulate transcription. Several findings indicate that this retrograde 
transport involves signaling endosomes: TGFβ ligands and receptors are transported 
in vesicles along axons (39); and nuclear phospho-SMAD as well as the functional 
effects of TGFβ signaling are both blocked by inhibitors of the dynein motor protein 
pathway (3, 54). 
Studies in Drosophila have also revealed a role for importin-mediated signaling 
during axon guidance and synapse formation. Thus, Kumar et al. (45) expressed a 
truncated importin β, which acts as a general inhibitor of all importin-mediated"

nuclear import, in the Drosophila eye disc at a time when photoreceptors project 
their axons to the brain. Photoreceptors initially projected their axons correctly but 
later failed to enter the optic stalk, leading to an extensive network of misguided 
axons. Disruption of importin function also led to adhesion defects that caused neu-
rons to descend below the appropriate layer. The authors concluded that axon guid-
ance and cell adhesion in the eye rely on importin β-mediated nuclear signaling. 
4.2 Transport of Signals from Synapse to Nucleus During Synaptic 
Plasticity 
Long-lasting forms of memory and of learning-related synaptic plasticity have been 
shown to depend on transcription (2, 42), indicating that signals received at distal 
synapses are transmitted to the nucleus. Studies in a variety of systems have revealed 
roles for rapid action potential mediated signaling, importin-mediated active nuclear 
import as well as for signaling endosome-mediated transport during transcription-
dependent plasticity. Many of these studies have focused on the activity-dependent 
induction of transcription mediated by the cAMP-responsive element binding protein 
(CREB). This approach is based on research showing that long-term facilitation 
(LTF) of Aplysia sensory-motor synapses, long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippo-
campal synapses, and long-term hippocampal-mediated memories in rodents all 
require cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-driven gene expression (43, 49). The tran-
scriptional activity of CREB is activated by phosphorylation at a particular site, 
serine 133, and antibodies that specifically recognize CREB phosphorylated at this 
site (21) have been very useful in identifying pathways whereby activity leads to 
CREB phosphorylation in the nucleus during long-term synaptic plasticity. Such 
studies have shown that both calcium and cAMP signaling cascades trigger CREB 
phosphorylation, and have defined roles for a number of specific kinases, including 
calcium-calmodulin dependent kinases (CaMKs), MAPKs, and the cAMP-dependent 
kinase (PKA). 
Studies of plasticity at mammalian hippocampal synapses have revealed roles for 
rapid calcium-dependent signaling to the nucleus during transcription-dependent 
LTP. Thus, Dudek and Fields (18) have demonstrated that somatic action potentials 
are sufficient to induce CREB phosphorylation and to induce specific immediate 
early genes in hippocampal neurons. Based on these findings, Dudek has argued that 
a synapse-to-nucleus signal is not required to induce transcription during the late 
phase of hippocampal LTP (1). Consistent with this idea, Bading and colleagues (31) 
have shown that depolarization and electrical stimulation of cultured hippocampal 
neurons can lead to CREB phosphorylation in a manner that depends entirely on 
calcium waves in the nucleus and is independent of any import of cytoplasmic pro-
teins into the nucleus. These studies indicate that depolarizing stimuli trigger action 
potentials and/or regenerative calcium waves in the ER, and that the increased cal-
cium in the nucleus in turn activates nuclear kinases that phosphorylate CREB and 
activate CRE-driven gene expression. 
Earlier studies from Richard Tsien and colleagues (16) had shown that brief 
bursts of activity in cultured hippocampal neurons triggered CREB phosphorylation 
within one minute, and that this was mediated by the translocation of calmodulin"

from the somatic cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it activated CamKIV. The Tsien 
group (82) also demonstrated that strongly depolarizing stimuli recruited a second 
pathway that leads to CREB phosphorylation. Activation of this pathway, the 
ras/MAPK pathway resulted in a slower and more persistent phosphorylation of 
CREB. Bading and colleagues (30) also described a pathway whereby bursts of ac-
tivity in cultured hippocampal neurons led to calcium increases near NMDA recep-
tors, which in turn activated MAPK. MAPK then translocated into the nucleus, 
where it activated both serum response element (SRE)-driven gene expression as 
well as CREB phosphorylation. Notably, the phosphorylation of CREB mediated by 
MAPK nuclear translocation was more sustained than CREB phosphorylation medi-
ated by nuclear calcium increases. Together, these studies indicate that depolarizing 
stimuli can activate cytosolic signaling molecules that are subsequently transported 
into the nucleus where they function to alter transcription. They further reveal that 
signaling to the nucleus can occur in a more rapid and transient manner or in more 
sustained and persistent manner. What remained unclear from these experiments, 
however, was whether or not these signaling molecules were transported from distal 
synapses to the nucleus or whether the signaling molecules were generated in the 
soma in response to depolarization, and subsequently transported into the nucleus. 
That signals can indeed be transported from distal synapses to the nucleus during 
learning-related synaptic plasticity is clear from studies of long-term facilitation of 
Aplysia sensory-motor synapses. At this synapse, five spaced applications of the 
modulatory neurotransmitter serotonin (5HT) produce LTF, which is dependent on 
both mRNA and protein synthesis (42). Localized application of 5HT to distal synap-
tic sites is sufficient to recruit transcription-dependent LTF (50, 69), indicating that 
signals can in fact travel from a distal synpase to the nucleus. 5HT stimulation of 
sensory neurons increases cAMP concentrations in the sensory neuron, leading to 
activation of PKA and MAPK (62). Importantly, 5HT does not increase intracellular 
calcium in sensory neurons (13) and does not depolarize sensory neurons, indicating 
that the signal is likely to travel as a soluble signal through the cytoplasm, and not as 
an electrical signal or in the form of an intracellular calcium wave. 
Thompson et al. (73) have provided evidence that importins function to carry 
signals from distal Aplysia synapses to the nucleus during LTF. Thus, they found that 
importin α was present at the synapse of Aplysia sensory-motor neurons, and further 
showed that stimuli that elicited LTF triggered importin translocation into the nu-
cleus of the sensory neuron. Inhibition of importin-mediated transport into the nu-
cleus by microinjection of anti-nuclear pore antibodies into the sensory neuron 
blocked LTF without affecting basal synaptic transmission or short term, transcrip-
tion-independent plasticity. In the same study, Thompson and colleagues also 
showed that importins were present at synapses of rodent hippocampal neurons, and 
that importin α was present in post-synaptic density fractions. Activation of the 
NMDA receptor in dissociated hippocampal neurons triggered translocation of im-
portins into the nucleus. In hippocampal slices, stimuli that elicited late-phase, tran-
scription-dependent LTP also induced an NMDA receptor-dependent increase in the 
concentration of importin in the nuclei of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Together, these 
findings indicate that importins function to carry signals from the synapse to the nu-
cleus during transcription-dependent forms of learning-related synaptic plasticity (58)."

What are the cargoes of importins that travel from the synapse to the nucleus dur-
ing synaptic plasticity? A number of interesting candidate molecules exist, although 
direct demonstration that importins do transport these molecules from synapse to 
nucleus during plasticity is lacking. Some of these cargoes are transcription factors 
that localize constitutively to the cytoplasm, and travel to the nucleus following 
stimulation. One such cargo is the nuclear factor-kappa b (NF-κB), which has been 
shown to translocate from synapse to nucleus of hippocampal neurons following 
glutamatergic stimulation and to play a role in learning and memory (55, 75). A 
recent study demonstrated that the retrograde transport of NFκB in hippocampal 
neurons occurs along microtubules, and that it requires dynein motor proteins and an 
intact NLS in NFκB (57). This study thus strongly suggests that importins do func-
tion to carry NFκB from synapse to nucleus. Nuclear factor of activated T-cells 
(NFATc4) is another transcription factor that has been shown to undergo stimulus-
dependent translocation from dendrites to nucleus in hippocampal neurons (25, 26). 
It also contains an NLS and is known to require importins for its nuclear transport 
(81), suggesting that it may translocate to the nucleus in an importin-dependent man-
ner. In Aplysia neurons, a recent study by Kaang and colleagues (46) discovered that 
during LTF of sensory-motor synapses, a cell-adhesion molecule associated protein 
(CAMAP) is phosphorylated by PKA and translocates from the synapse to the nu-
cleus where it functions as a transcriptional co-activator. CAMAP was found to 
interact with importin α, suggesting that it may be transported through the neurite in 
an importin-dependent manner. Studies in a number of systems have revealed roles 
for nuclear translocation of kinases, including PKA and MAPK, during transcription-
dependent forms of plasticity (42, 72), and these signaling molecules are thus also 
potential cargoes of importins for trafficking from distal synapses to the nucleus 
(although, see (78)). 
Studies of the role of brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) suggest a role for sig-
naling endosomes in transmitting signals from synapse to nucleus during transcrip-
tion-dependent plasticity. Thus, BDNF binding to the TrkB receptor has been shown 
to be critical to long-lasting forms of long-term potentiation at hippocampal synapses 
(44, 59). Since BDNF-bound TrkB receptors are internalized into endosomes and 
subsequently travel to the nucleus in signaling endosomes (86), it is possible that 
BDNF recruits a signaling endosome pathway to transmit signals to the nucleus 
during learning-related synaptic plasticity. 
4.3 Transport of Signals from Distal Axons to the Nucleus During Injury 
and Regeneration 
In the peripheral nervous system, regeneration following axonal injury requires new 
transcription, indicating that signals are transmitted from the site of injury to the cell 
body (for review see (28, 70)). The transcriptional component includes (1) a rapid 
component that depends on injury-induced action potentials that signal from the site 
of injury to the soma; and (2) a slower component that depends both on a decrease in 
the normal trafficking of trophic factors to the soma and on the transport of injury-
induced signals from the site of injury to the nucleus (28, 61). Studies of injury-
induced growth in Aplysia neurons has provided clear evidence that injury-induced"

signals are transported to the nucleus. Thus, Richard Ambron and colleagues (6, 85) 
have shown that axoplasm isolated from lesioned neurons elicits neuronal growth 
when microinjected into uninjured neurons. They found that many of these proteins 
contained NLSs, suggesting that they used importin-mediated transport mechanisms 
to be transported from the site of injury to the nucleus (4). 
Studies in lesioned dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and in sciatic nerve have 
provided strong evidence that importins play a central role in carrying signals from 
sites of injury to the nucleus (29, 60). In these studies, Michael Fainzilber and col-
leagues showed that importin α was present in axons. They further showed that im-
portin β1 mRNA was present in axons where it was locally translated following 
axonal injury. Saturation of the active import pathway with excess NLS peptides 
delayed regenerative outgrowth in culture and inhibited the growth-enhancing effects 
of an in vivo conditioning lesion. These findings are consistent with importin-
mediated signaling functioning to transport injury signals to the nucleus to initiate 
transcription-dependent regeneration. 
5 Concluding Remarks 
Sites of signal initiation in neurons can occur at great distances from the nucleus. In 
the case of dendrites, synapses can be hundreds of microns away from the soma, and 
in the case of axons, synapses can be as far as a meter from the soma. These dis-
tances pose a significant challenge to the transport of signals from the site of initia-
tion to the nucleus. Given that many processes in neurons depend on stimulus-
induced changes in gene expression, the question of how signals are transported from 
distal sites to the nucleus is of great interest. 
A number of mechanisms exist whereby signals can be delivered from their site 
of initiation to the nucleus. Rapid signaling mechanisms include (1) electrochemical 
signaling to the soma via action potentials or dendritic spikes and (2) regenerative 
calcium waves in the ER. Slower signaling mechanisms include (1) active transport 
of signaling molecules from distal compartments to the nucleus, either as soluble 
proteins (e.g. via importin-mediated retrograde transport) or as signaling endosomes, 
as well as (2) passive diffusion of signaling molecules to the nucleus. When and how 
neurons use each of these cell biological pathways is only beginning to be eluci-
dated. The data indicate that distinct stimuli likely recruit distinct synapse-to-nucleus 
signaling pathways, and that each of these functions to produce changes over various 
time domains. Cell biological investigations into the mechanisms of signal transduc-
tion between synapse and nucleus, and between growth cone and nucleus, promise to 
provide insight into the many physiological and pathological processes in the brain 
that depend on stimulus-induced changes in gene expression.

The majority of fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous 
system (CNS) is mediated by γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAA recep-
tors), whereas in the brain stem and spinal cord fast inhibition is primarily mediated 
by glycine receptors where they can be associated with GABAA receptors at mixed 
synapses. GABAA receptors and glycine receptors are pentameric hetero-oligomeric 
ligand gated ion channels, the activation of which leads to the opening of an integral 
chloride permeable channel (Fig. 1). When chloride is low intracellularly, as in most 
adult neurons, this results in a chloride influx into the cell, resulting in cell hyperpo-
larization, moving the membrane potential away from the spike threshold for action 
potential generation. GABAA receptors and glycine receptors play a key role in regu-
lating neuronal excitability, therefore modulating their function has important impli-
cations for regulating cell and network activity in the nervous system. In addition 
GABAA receptors are drug targets for many clinically relevant compounds including 
benzodiazepines, barbiturates, ethanol, neurosteroids and some anesthetics. Altera-
tions in GABAA receptor and glycine receptor function have been implicated in an 
 
Correct synaptic inhibition is dependent on the formation and maintenance of 
inhibitory postsynaptic domains where postsynaptic GABA and/or glycine receptors 
can be recruited and stabilized below release sites for their cognate neurotransmitter. 
The formation and maintenance of inhibitory synapses depends on the dynamic re-
cruitment of cell adhesion molecules and scaffold proteins to sites opposing inhibi-
tory presynaptic terminals. In addition, the correct function of inhibitory synapses is

toxin. The site of action for these drugs is believed to be inside the chloride permeable channel.

therefore be regulated by modulation of both the function and number of synaptic 
GABA and glycine receptors, controlled by receptor associated proteins that facili-

1 Pharmacology of GABAA and Glycine Receptors 
The three major GABA receptor types in the brain were initially identified based on 
their pharmacological and electrophysiological properties. GABA type A receptors 
(GABAA receptors) are ligand-gated ion channels, activated by muscimol and inhib-
ited by bicuculline (141). A second GABA receptor (termed GABAB receptor) is 
insensitive to these agents, but is activated by baclofen, inhibited by 2-
hydroxysaclofen and produces a slower inhibitory response (20, 91). GABAB recep-
tors are G protein-coupled receptors that mediate their inhibitory effects by coupling 
to ion channels (for a detailed review of GABAB receptors see (45)). In addition to 
GABAA and GABAB receptors, a third GABA receptor type (GABAC receptor), 
insensitive to both bicuculline and baclofen, but sensitive to the GABA analogue cis-
4-aminocrotonic acid and picrotoxin, has also been identified (56, 162, 180). GABAC 
receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, homologous in structure to the GABAA 
receptor but are primarily expressed in the retina (56, 162). Glycine receptors are 
primarily expressed in the brain stem and spinal cord where they play a crucial role 
in regulating inhibitory tone (49, 228). Glycine receptors are similar in structure to 
GABAA and GABAC receptors, are activated by glycine and also potentially taurine, 
but are insensitive to picrotoxin and instead are inhibited by the plant alkaloid 
strychnine (139). 
 
A range of compounds, several of which are clinically relevant therapeutic 
agents, can allosterically modulate GABAA receptor and glycine receptor function. 
GABAA receptor function is modulated by benzodiazepines, barbiturates, steroids, 
anesthetics and ethanol (141, 157, 181) (Fig.1). Benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) 
potentiate GABA responses by increasing GABAA channel opening frequency (141, 
209). Diazepam has also been reported to increase channel conductance of some 
native receptors (58), which may be due to receptor interactions with GABAA recep-
tor associated proteins (62). Barbiturates, such as pentobarbital, enhance GABA 
responses by increasing the open probability of GABA-activated channels and have 
also been reported to enhance single channel conductance of some native receptors, 
and directly activate GABAA receptors at high concentrations (11, 18, 59, 141, 144, 
209). General anesthetics such as isoflurane and halothane increase GABA-induced 
currents by potentiating the action of GABA or by directly activating the channel 
(for reviews see (66, 81)). Ethanol has also been shown to have a potentiating effect 
on GABAA receptors (for reviews see (51, 141, 171, 189)). Recently, elegant work 
from several groups have reported that GABAA receptors containing the δ subunit 
are enhanced by low alcohol concentrations that are thought to mediate alcohol ef-
fects experienced during social drinking, although several controversies with respect 
to these findings remain (for detailed discussions see (158, 171, 189)). GABAA re-
ceptors are also subject to regulation by several endogenous modulators including 
steroids, protons and Zn2+ (9, 93, 141). At low nanomolar concentrations which 
occur during stress, alcohol intoxication and pregnancy/oestrous, neurosteroids, such 
as allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosteroneprogesterone, can potentiate 
GABA responses. At higher concentrations (submicromolar to micromolar), which 
may occur during parturition, neurosteroids can directly activate the receptor (for 
detailed reviews see (9, 93, 124, 157)). GABAA receptors are also inhibited by a"

number of pharmacological agents. Picrotoxin, a plant convulsant, is a noncompeti-
tive GABAA receptor inhibitor that is thought to act by binding to a site within the 
channel (241) leading to stabilization of receptors in an agonist bound desensitized 
state (164). In addition, GABAA receptors lacking the γ subunit, and therefore likely 
extrasynaptic, are inhibited by Zn2+ (201). Although the pharmacology of glycine 
receptors is not as rich as that of GABA receptors, glycine receptor function is en-
hanced by several of the same agents that potentiate GABA receptors, such as alco-
hols, anesthetics, and neurosteroids (30, 81, 87, 128, 153). Glycine receptors are also 
sensitive to Zn2+ which potentiates receptor activation at submicromolar Zn2+ con-
centrations, but causes inhibition at concentrations greater than 10 μM (13, 201). In a 
physiological context, low nanomolar basal Zn2+ concentrations are sufficient to 
prolong the decay phase of glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (128). In 
contrast, an equivalent of benzodiazepines is lacking for glycine receptors. 
2 Molecular Identification of GABAA Receptors and Glycine 
Receptors 
GABAA receptors and glycine receptors are members of the Cys-loop ligand gated 
ion channel family of receptors, which also include nicotinic acetylcholine receptors 
(nACh receptors), GABAC receptors and serotonin (5HT3) receptors (44, 192, 222). 
The glycine receptor was the first neurotransmitter receptor to be isolated from the 
mammalian brain using aminostrychnine-agarose affinity chromatography, taking 
advantage of the high affinity interaction (KD 1–10 nM) of the receptor with strych-
nine (175). The receptor appeared to be a complex of three proteins: a 48 kDa α 
subunit, 58 kDa β subunit, and an additional 93 kDa protein (80). Several biochemi-
cal studies of the purified form of glycine receptors have established that the integral 
membrane α and β subunit glycoproteins represent the constitutive subunits of the 
receptor (122). Cross-linking techniques showed that α and β subunits assemble to 
form the channel-containing transmembrane core of the glycine receptor. The size of 
the complex (250 kDa) suggested a pentameric assembly of the subunits giving a 
quaternary structure that is now well established for all members of the Cys-loop 
family of receptors (Fig. 1). In contrast to the receptor, the co-purifying 93-kDa 
protein, gephyrin, is a nonglycosylated polypeptide that can interact reversibly with 
the α/β pentamer. Gephyrin is a cytoplasmic extrinsic membrane protein that plays a 
key role in regulating glycine receptor localization as discussed below.  
3 Molecular Diversity and Distribution Pattern of Glycine 
Receptor Subunit Isoforms 
Initial biochemical and immunochemical studies during spinal cord development 
established the notion of glycine receptor subtypes (128). A comparison of glycine 
receptor expression in neonatal and adult membranes revealed that a distinct form of 
glycine receptor predominated around birth (neonatal receptor, GlyRN). It is charac-"

terized pharmacologically by its relatively low strychnine-binding affinity. It is com-
posed of pentamers of 49 kDa polypetides denominated α2 and it is found mainly 
during the fetal and neonatal stages. This supported the notion of a developmental 
switch from GlyRN to the adult form, GlyRA, corresponding to the formation of 
α1/β heteromers. This switch occurs in the spinal cord within 3 weeks after birth, 
and is not as complete in other regions of the nervous system. One current view is 
that postsynaptic glycine receptors correspond to a mixture of α2 pentamers and 
α2/β heteromers in immature neurons, while α1/β heteromers predominate in mature 
synapses. Currently, the greater diversity of glycine receptor subunits is established 
to include not only α1 and α2 but also α3 and α2* subunits (139) and in addition an 
α4 subunit has also been identified in mouse, which is absent in rat and human 
(145). These highly homologous isoforms can form glycine-gated chloride channels 
of comparable strychnine sensitivity, except α2*, which is 99% identical to human 
α2 shows a 500-fold lower sensitivity to strychnine (123). Further, alternative exon 
usage increases glycine receptor diversity. For the α1 subunit, eight additional amino 
acids can be inserted in the M3–M4 loop. This sequence contains a serine residue, 
which is a potential phosphorylation site allowing a functional modulation of the α1 
subunit. Alternative splicing has also been identified for the α2 and α3 subunits (139).  
 
In situ hybridization (122, 182) revealed that the distribution of individual gly-
cine receptor subunits was not identical for all variants. The mRNAs encoding the 
α1 and α3 subunits are mainly transcribed in spinal cord and brain stem at later 
postnatal stages. The α3 subunit mRNA is present in the infralimbic system, the 
hippocampal complex, and the cerebellar granular layer. Expression levels of the α2 
subunit, by contrast, are high in the embryonic and perinatal stages, but barely de-
tectable in the adult brain, with some expression in higher cortical regions. The α4 
subunit, which is expressed at low levels in the adult brain and spinal cord, can form 
functional glycine receptors, which are restricted to the spinal cord and the sympa-
thetic nervous system. Compared to the α subunit transcripts, the β subunit mRNA is 
more widely expressed throughout the embryonic and adult nervous system (103) 
and is found in brain loci devoid of strychnine-binding sites or glycine receptor im-
munoreactivity. The physiological significance of this widespread β subunit mRNA 
expression is not understood, and there is no evidence that glycine receptor β sub-
units assemble with subunits of other Cys-loop receptor family members. 
4 Molecular Heterogeneity of GABAA Receptors 
A total of 16 genes encoding GABAA receptor subunits have been identified in the 
mammalian nervous system. The GABAA receptor was initially purified using 
GABA/benzodiazepine affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed two 
receptor subunits, α and β, with molecular weights of 53 kDa and 58 kDa respec-
tively (199, 200). Oligonucleotides, designed based on peptide microsequencing 
results, were used for screening bovine cDNA libraries and allowed for the cloning 
of both α and β subunits. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of α and β subunits 
revealed that these receptor subunits showed significant homology with each other 
and with other members of the Cys-loop receptors such as the nAChRs. Based on"

amino acid sequence homology six α subunits as well as three β subunits have been 
identified (96, 98, 133, 134, 137, 142, 238). Co-expression of α and β subunits in 
heterologous systems, however, formed receptors that lacked benzodiazepine sensi-
tivity, a pharmacological trait observed in neuronal GABAA receptors. A novel 
GABAA receptor subunit that when co-expressed with α and β subunits inferred 
benzodiazepine sensitivity on the assembled receptors was then identified (179). This 
subunit, termed γ2, shows 42% and 35% identity to the α1 and β1 subunits respec-
tively. Three γ subunits have been identified in total (179, 197, 231, 239). In addition 
to α, β and γ subunits other receptor subunits have been identified: δ (197), ε (50), π 
(90) and θ (17). In addition some of these genes, including the α6 (121), β2 (146), β3 
(101), ε (230) and γ2 subunits (229), undergo alternative splicing resulting in a long 
(L) and short (S) version of the gene product. However, a complete understanding of 
the physiological relevance of these splice variants remains to be addressed. 
 
In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies have provided a detailed 
picture of the regional and cellular expression patterns of GABAA receptor subunit 
mRNA and corresponding receptor subunit protein, in the nervous system (67, 82, 
126, 127, 159, 174, 176, 198, 232, 240). The α1, β2/3, and γ2 subunits are the most 
abundant and broadly expressed GABAA receptor subunits in the brain and spinal 
cord (126, 174, 176, 232). In agreement with this, gene deletion studies have re-
vealed that α1 and β2 subunits account for up to half of all GABAA receptors in the 
CNS (212). The α1 subunit is found to be present, at high levels, in most regions of 
the adult brain (88, 176) but not in embryonic or neonatal brain, where it is expressed 
at low levels (127). The α2 subunit is found in most brain regions, except the thala-
mus and globus pallidum, although at lower levels than the α1 subunit (176). The α3 
and α4 are the least abundant α subunits in the adult brain. The α3 subunit is highly 
expressed in early developmental stages, but at low levels in the adult brain (176, 
240) where it is concentrated in the cerebral cortex, mainly on monoaminergic neu-
rons (72), the basal forebrain, on cholinergic neurons (73), and the thalamic reticular 
nucleus (69). In contrast the α4 subunit is restricted to the thalamus, the striatum and 
the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (176, 232). The α5 subunit is evenly ex-
pressed throughout development and enriched in the CA1 region of the hippocam-
pus, although expression levels show a continuous decrease with aging (240). In 
contrast the α6 subunit is found almost exclusively, postnatally in the granular layer 
of the cerebellum (126, 127, 176).  
 
Despite a wide distribution of all three β subunits, β1 is expressed at much lower 
levels compared to β2 and β3 subunits (176). Although there is considerable overlap 
in the expression of β2 and β3 subunits, there are some regions where higher expres-
sion of one β subunit in certain brain regions comes at the expense of another. For 
example, β2 subunits are highly expressed in the adult thalamus in comparison to β1 
and β3 subunits (176, 194, 232), although the β3 subunit is expressed at higher levels 
than the β2 in the fetal and neo-natal thalamus (127). The β3 subunit is expressed at 
high levels in the striatum where very low levels of the β2 subunit are found. In 
addition, β1 and β3 subunits are found at higher concentrations than the β2 subunit in 
the hippocampus (232). Furthermore, in the hippocampus, the β2 subunit is found 
concentrated in non-pyramidal neurons, whereas β1 and β3 subunits are found in 
primary pyramidal neurons (155, 161, 176, 232)."

Of the γ subunit isoforms, the γ2 subunit is, by far, the most abundant. However, 
all three γ subunits are found widely distributed, with the γ1 subunit expressed at 
higher concentrations in the pallidum and substantia nigra whereas the γ3 subunit is 
slightly more concentrated in the cerebral cortex (126, 127, 176, 232). Similar to 
other GABAA receptor subunits, the expression of γ1 and γ3 is altered during devel-
opment, with these two subunits being expressed at higher levels pre-natally (127). 
Furthermore, the γ2 subunit also shows a small but significant reduction in expres-
sion levels with aging (240). Importantly, the γ1 and γ3 subunits are unable to fully 
substitute for the essential γ2 subunit in γ2 knockout mice, which show a lethal phe-
notype (4, 61). In contrast to the γ subunits, the δ subunit of GABAA receptors is 
most highly expressed in the thalamus and in the granular layer of the cerebellum 
where it is thought to assemble into receptors which contain either α4 or α6 subunits, 
respectively (176). The ε, π and θ subunits are the least abundant GABAA receptor 
subunits expressed in the CNS. The ε subunit has been observed in the hypothala-
mus, amygdala and brainstem (160). Interestingly, the θ subunit has also been ob-
served in all these regions as well as the substantia nigra and hippocampus (160). 
The π subunit appears to be expressed mainly in the uterus, although low expression 
levels have been observed in the hippocampus (90). 
5 GABAA and Glycine Receptor Structure  
GABAA receptors, glycine receptors and the other members of the Cys-loop receptor 
family are polytopic type I membrane proteins that share a common subunit structure 
(44). Each subunit encompasses a large extended N-terminal domain, bearing poten-
tial glycosylation sites, four highly conserved transmembrane domains (deduced by 
hydropathy analysis), and a large intracellular loop of significantly lower homology 
between TM3 and TM4 which protrudes into the cytoplasm (TM3–TM4 loop; Fig. 1). 
The four membrane-spanning domains form α helices (TM2) and/or β strands (TM1, 
TM3, TM4). Based on extensive biochemical and electron microscopy analysis of 
the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, members of this family are assumed to be pen-
tameric in structure where subunits are arranged around a central aqueous pore (222). 
The tertiary and quaternary structure of the soluble pentameric acetylcholine-binding 
protein (AChBP), which shares approximately 20% sequence homology with 
nAChR, GABA and glycine receptors, has been useful in further elucidating struc-
ture–function parameters for receptors of the family (21, 202). In addition to improv-
ing our understanding of the binding of agonists, antagonists and modulators, (1, 35, 
92, 93, 201), the AChBP crystal structure provides a powerful model of the N-
terminal domain of the Cys-loop receptor family. AChBP is mainly a sandwich of 
antiparallel β sheets positioning conserved residues in order to stabilize the protom-
ers, whereas variable residues are at their interface (21, 202). The topology of the 
transmembrane domains (Fig. 1) delineates the ion permeation pathway away from 
the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer. For all Cys-loop receptors, the 
subunit’s α-helical TM2 domain lines the central water-filled pore, while TM1, 
TM3, and TM4 form the interface with the lipids and isolate TM2 from a hydropho-
bic environment (44). Recent studies on the GlyR α1 subunit have challenged the"

four-helix model and provide evidence that whereas TM2 and TM4 are entirely 
helical, TM1 and TM3 also contain β strands. 
6 Glycine Receptor Assembly  
The α1 and β subunits assemble as a pentameric complex of 2α:3β stoichiometry 
(84, 102). Short amino acid sequences, named assembly boxes, all located in the N-
terminal domain of the β subunit and corresponding to three diverging motifs in α 
and β subunits, have been identified (83, 102, 154). They have a role in determining 
receptor assembly. Replacement of these motifs in the β subunit by the correspond-
ing α1 motifs results in the loss of the subunit ratio in α/β oligomers, suggesting that 
different amino acid positions are determinants in the early step of subunit–subunit 
interaction. These residues impose a mutually exclusive mode of assembly, either in 
complexes of invariant α/β stoichiometry or in homo-oligomers. A 2α−3β stoi-
chiometry has recently been established following affinity purification of expressed 
engineered tandem subunits (84). These experiments indicated that the β subunit 
contributes to the agonist binding properties of hetero-oligomeric α1/β glycine re-
ceptors. In fact, ionic interactions at the α/β interface are required to stabilize glycine 
in its binding pocket. This feature, with an agonist binding shared between two adja-
cent subunits is characteristic of the Cys-loop receptor family and also holds true for 
GABAA receptors (102, 162). 
7 GABAA Receptor Assembly and Composition of Plasma 
Membrane Receptors 
The large diversity of GABAA receptor subunits generates the potential for a bewil-
dering heterogeneity of receptor structure. However, a number of functional, bio-
chemical and immunocytochemical studies have revealed that only a limited number 
of receptor subunit combinations are likely to exist on the neuronal cell surface (162, 
198). Restriction on GABAA receptor molecular heterogeneity in the brain is due to a 
number of factors. GABAA receptor subunit composition is in part restricted by the 
regional and temporal selectivity in subunit expression (69, 176, 198). In addition, a 
number of assembly rules further restrict the heterogeneity of native GABAA recep-
tors (44). Expression studies indicated that individual GABAA receptor subunits do 
not result in the formation of GABA gated channels. Expression of β1 and β3 sub-
units alone results in the formation of chloride permeable channels that are sensitive 
to picrotoxin and barbiturates, however, these channels are insensitive to application 
of GABA. In contrast, co-expression of α and β subunits results in the production of 
functional GABA gated chloride channels sensitive to picrotoxin, bicuculline, barbi-
turates and Zn2+ (55, 133, 192). This is in agreement with the binding site for GABA 
lying at the interface of α and β subunits (14, 15, 141). However, the co-expression 
of α and β subunits does not form channels that are sensitive to benzodiazepine 
modulation, which represents the pharmacology of most native receptors. It is only"

when γ subunits are additionally co-expressed with α and β subunits that GABA 
gated, benzodiazepine sensitive channels are formed (239) (179), which are in addi-
tion insensitive to Zn2+ modulation (201).  
 
As shown with fluorescence, only certain GABAA receptor subunit combinations 
can access the cell surface whereas other subunit combinations are retained within the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (15, 43, 44, 162). This suggested the existence of mo-
lecular mechanisms to restrict the surface expression of receptors with given composi-
tions. With exception of the β1, β3 and γ2S subunits, individual GABAA receptor 
subunits are mostly retained in the ER (43). Moreover, pulse chase experiments dem-
onstrated that α1 and β2 subunits are rapidly degraded when expressed alone (77), 
suggesting that these proteins are targeted for degradation from the ER. Importantly, 
GABAA receptor subunits have been shown to associate with BiP and calnexin (43, 
77), two chaperone molecules which assist in protein quality control in the ER (114). 
Initial studies suggested that assembly was dependent on the N-terminus of receptor 
subunits. Using a chimeric approach, four amino acids in the N-terminal domain of 
the β3 subunit have been shown to mediate functional cell surface expression of this 
subunit compared to β2 (215, 216). Introduction of these four amino acids into the N-
terminus of the β2 subunit is sufficient to enable β2 homomerization and ER exit. 
These four amino acids are also important for the oligomerization of β subunits with γ 
subunits but not with α subunits. Interestingly, mutation of these four amino acids 
within the β3 subunit abolished its ability to form homomers but not its ability to 
oligomerize with γ2L suggesting that at least one alternative signal for the assembly 
of β and γ subunits must exist (215, 216). A conserved domain in the N-terminus of α 
subunits has also been identified to play a role in the oligomerization of α with β but 
not γ subunits (15, 16, 215, 216). Furthermore, conserved glutamine and arginine 
residues have been shown to independently play a key role in determining the assem-
bly of α with β subunits (15, 16, 215, 216), whereas a conserved arginine in α, β and γ 
subunits has been shown to be essential for subunit oligomerization (85). Finally, two 
regions within the N-terminus of the γ2 subunit have been shown to mediate assembly 
of this subunit with α and β subunits (111, 112). The above results together with bio-
chemical experiments suggest that the most prevalent GABAA receptor subunit com-
position in the brain consists of α, β and γ subunits with a majority of receptors con-
taining 2α, 2β and 1γ subunit isoform (16, 68, 138, 141, 162).  
8 Role of GABAA Receptor Subunit Composition in Determining 
Subcellular Localization 
Immunofluorescence and EM immunogold studies have revealed that α1, α2, α3, 
α6, β2/3 and γ2 subunits are enriched at postsynaptic domains of inhibitory synapses 
in many brain regions including cortex, hippocampus, globus pallidus and cerebel-
lum (61, 64, 67–69, 166, 167, 198). These synaptically targeted receptor subunits can 
also be found extrasynaptically (64). Immunocytochemical and immunogold electron 
microscopy studies have revealed that GABAA receptor subunit combinations can be 
targeted to different subcellular domains (67, 68, 166–168). For example, although 
the α1–3 and α5 subunits are all expressed in hippocampal and cerebellar cells, the"

I.L. Arancibia-Carcamo et al. 
 
α2 subunit is found concentrated in the axon initial segment (AIS) of the majority of 
cells where it colocalizes with the inhibitory synaptic marker gephyrin (25, 168). In 
contrast, the α1 subunit is found throughout the cell and shows both diffuse and 
clustered staining suggesting both a synaptic and extrasynaptic localization (25). 
Interestingly, the α1 subunit cannot be found in the AIS on its own and is always co-
localized there with the α2 subunit suggesting that subunit composition of GABAA 
receptors in the AIS consists of one copy of α1 and one of α2 (25). Recent functional 
experiments in hippocampal pyramidal neurons have revealed that fast phasic re-
sponses are mediated by synaptic α2 subunit containing GABAA receptors on the 
cell soma but synaptic α1 containing GABAA receptors on dendrites (177). Recep-
tors containing α3 are differentially targeted depending on the cell type where they 
are expressed. In pyramidal cells, the α3 subunit is found in clusters at postsynaptic 
sites, whereas in a subset of hippocampal cells characterized by a round cell body 
and numerous short dendrites, α3 containing receptors show a diffuse expression 
pattern across the membrane and are not found at synaptic sites (25). α5 subunits 
have been found highly expressed in extrasynaptic locations on hippocampal den-
drites where it has been proposed they may contribute to tonic inhibition (25), but 
have also been localized to synapses both by immunofluorescence and EM postem-
bedding immunogold (40, 195). 
 
In addition to the α subunit, receptor subcellular localization is also determined 
by the γ and δ subunits. In the cerebellum, immunocytochemical studies on electron 
microscopic sections demonstrated that synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors 
differed in their subunit composition. Synapses in cerebellar granule neurons are 
positive for the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit, whereas the δ subunit was found exclu-
sively in extrasynaptic membranes (165). In the hippocampus δ subunits are local-
ized perisynaptically and not at synapses (227). Interestingly, in the cerebellum pha-
sic and tonic GABAA receptor mediated inhibition has been observed and this has 
been attributed to synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors respectively (22, 23). 
Furthermore, in addition to immunocytochemical studies that show γ2 and δ subunits 
being respectively targeted to synaptic and extrasynaptic sites, electrophysiological 
studies have confirmed that the γ2 subunit mediates phasic inhibition whereas the δ 
subunit plays a role in mediating tonic inhibition (23, 24, 206). In agreement with 
this γ2 subunit GABAA receptor knockout (KO) experiments have demonstrated the 
critical role of the γ2 subunit in mediating the synaptic targeting of GABAA receptors 
which is critical for correct animal behavior (2, 47, 61). Overall, it is proposed based 
on work from immunofluorescent, EM, functional and gene deletion studies, that α1, 
α2 or α3 subunits, co assembled with the γ2 subunit and β subunit variants, are the 
major receptor subtypes localized to inhibitory synapses and contributing to phasic 
inhibition (64). In contrast, α5 subunit containing receptors assembled with the γ2 
subunit and β subunit variants, and α4 or α6 subunits co assembled with the δ subunit 
and β subunit variants are primarily localized extrasynaptically and mediate tonic inhi-
bition (29, 64). Recently it has been demonstrated that in some cell types such as hip-
pocampal interneurons, the α1 subunit may also assemble with the δ subunit and β 
subunit variants to form extrasynaptic receptors mediating tonic inhibition suggesting 
that novel GABAA receptor subunit partnerships may yet be identified (76)."

9 Components of the Inhibitory Postsynaptic Domain and Their 
Role in the Formation and Maintenance of Inhibitory Synapses 
 
 
Fig. 2. Schematic representation of a central inhibitory terminal.  
The specification and validation of inhibitory synapses and the correct apposition of 
inhibitory presynaptic terminals with inhibitory postsynaptic domains is thought to 
be determined in part by the co-ordinated action of adhesion molecules including 
cadherins, the neurexin-neuroligin 2 complex and the dystroglycan complex. Inhibi-
tory neurotransmitter receptors (GABAA and glycine) are confined to these inhibi-
tory specializations by scaffold molecules, most notably gephyrin, which can form a 
sub-synaptic clustered lattice important for synaptic receptor retention. Either di-
rectly or via intermediate binding partners, gephyrin can interact with cytoskeletal 
elements including tubulin and actin. The dystroglycan complex can interact with 
cytoplasmic binding partners including dystrobrevin and S-SCAM, which may also 
play a role in regulating receptor clustering and trafficking and furthermore, may 
also facilitate the co-clustering of both neurexin-neuroligin 2 and neurexin-
dystrolgycan complexes. 
Specific mechanisms must exist to specify the formation and maturation of synapses 
and the correct apposition of presynaptic terminals with postsynaptic domains con-
taining the correct cognate neurotransmitter receptors. In addition mechanisms must 
exist to direct and retain inhibitory receptors from intracellular or extrasynaptic  
compartments within the inhibitory postsynaptic apparatus. Several components of 
the inhibitory postsynaptic domains are proposed to play a key role in these proc-
esses, either as components of the inhibitory synaptic scaffold or by regulating trans-
port of receptors within the cell (Figs. 2 and 4)."

9.1 A Critical Role for Gephyrin in the Molecular Organization of 
Inhibitory Synaptic Domains 
One of the first proteins to be found enriched at inhibitory synapses is the ubiqui-
tously expressed 93 kDa protein gephyrin (221). Initially isolated as a protein co-
purifying with glycine receptors from rat spinal cord (175), gephyrin was found to be 
present in front of GABAergic terminal boutons (220) and was then demonstrated to 
play a central role in the organization of GABAergic synapses. Immunofluorescence 
and EM studies have conclusively shown that gephyrin is enriched at inhibitory 
GABAergic and glycinergic synapses (reviewed in (162)). However, several key 
differences remain between gephyrin regulation of glycinergic and GABAergic syn-
apses. Firstly, whereas a direct interaction between gephyrin and glycine receptors 
has been demonstrated between a 14 residue stretch in the glycine receptor β-subunit 
loop and gephyrin (151), the exact molecular mechanism whereby gephyrin is re-
cruited to GABAA receptors and whether or not gephyrin can interact either directly 
or indirectly via a bridging molecule with GABAA receptors remains unclear. Fur-
thermore, in contrast to glycine receptor clustering, not all GABAA receptor subtypes 
are clustered by gephyrin dependent mechanisms. However, gephyrin and γ2 subunit 
GABAA receptor mouse knockout experiments have emphasized the relationship 
between GABA receptor clustering and gephyrin (see below) (2, 61). 
9.2 Gephyrin Structure and Lattice Formation 
Several recent biochemical and structural studies have led to a model for the ability 
of gephyrin to forms clusters at inhibitory postsynaptic domains (7, 125). Gephyrin 
has a modular structure consisting of an N-terminal G-domain linked by a 170 resi-
due central region to a C-terminal E-domain (99, 204). This structure originates from 
the fusion of two genes of bacterial origin MogA and Moe, important for the biosyn-
thesis of molybdenum co-factor and homologous to gephyrin G- and E-domains 
respectively (3, 204, 236). Structural and biochemical data have revealed that the 
gephyrin N-terminal G-domain and the C-terminal E-domain can form trimers and 
dimers respectively (99, 203), suggesting a mechanism for the formation of a hex-
agonal submembrane lattice onto which inhibitory receptors can be sequestered  
(Fig. 3). In agreement with this, experiments using Blue Native-PAGE of affinity 
purified gephyrin expressed in Xenopus oocytes found gephyrin to run as hexamers, 
possibly dimers of trimers, in addition to some higher order complexes (188). In 
contrast oligomerization mutants no longer formed hexamers in this expression sys-
tem. The gephyrin hexamers may be a natural intermediate of gephyrin lattice forma-
tion. Initial structural and mapping studies have located the GlyR β-loop binding to 
the C-terminal E-domain of gephyrin (89, 193). More recently atomic resolution 
structural data define the GlyR β-loop as binding to each E-domain monomer in a 
pocket adjacent to the dimer interface. Complementary mutagenesis experiments 
reveal that β-loop binding is mediated by a hydrophobic interaction between 
phenylalanine 330 of gephyrin and two residues of the glycine receptor β-loop 
(phenylalanine 398, isoleucine 400) that are essential for this interaction. In contrast, 
the mechanisms of gephyrin recruitment to GABAA receptors or GABAA receptor 
recruitment to gephyrin, remain unknown."

(a) Domain and splicing map of gephyrin. The 93kDa protein is divided into three domains: An 
N-terminal G-domain (homologous to the bacterial gene product MogA), a linker region (L-
domain) and a C-terminal E-domain (homologous to the bacterial gene product MoeA). Gephy-
rin can exist in several splice variants termed C1-C7 and C4’-C6’, the sites where cassettes are 
subject to alternative splicing are shown. (b) Gephyrin may assemble as a hexagonal lattice by 
the formation of dimers of trimers. G-domains can come together to form a trimeric structure, 
which in turn can form dimers via their E-domains. (c) Molecular partners of the glycine recep-
tor/gephyrin complex. Gephyrin interacts with the intracellular loop of glycine β-subunits via its 
E-domain. This domain is also responsible for the interaction of gephyrin with other binding 
partners such as collybistin, profilin and VASP. RAFT-1 has been shown to interact with the E- 
and L-domains of gephyrin. Gephyrin has also been shown to bind microtubules via its G-
domain as well as the light chain of the microtubule motor dynein. 
 
 
Interestingly, gephyrin has several splice variants (147–149, 172, 173, 186) 
which may generate functional diversity and direct specific roles in regulating 
GABAAR function (Fig. 3). Gephyrin splicing appears to have no effect on high 
affinity interaction with the GlyR β-subunit but whether splicing may underlie 
gephyrin’s interaction with GABAA receptor clustering remains less clear (147–149, 
172, 173). On the other hand, gephyrin splicing within its central domain affects its 
ability to interact with various gephyrin associated proteins (102). Of greatest inter-
est, splicing also regulates the ability of gephyrin to form oligomers. Two groups"

have recently demonstrated that insertion of a gephyrin splice cassette C5’ into the 
gephyrin N-terminal G-domain interferes with N-terminal trimerization (7, 188). 
 
Several studies (e.g. (7)) have now demonstrated that interfering with gephyrin 
dimerization and trimerization inhibits gephyrin’s ability to form clusters in neurons. 
Gephyrin expression constructs containing substitutions at oligomerization interfaces 
have confirmed the essential role of G- and E-domains for clustering gephyrin at 
synapses. Furthermore, expression of recombinant gephyrin G- or E- domains, or 
dimerization or trimerization defective gephyrin mutants, disrupts gephyrin clusters 
in cultured neurons. Furthermore this causes disruption of both GABAA receptor and 
glycine receptor clusters at inhibitory postsynaptic sites supporting a critical role of 
gephyrin lattice formation in the maintenance of inhibitory postsynaptic domains. 
9.3 Gephyrin Associated Proteins  
Several gephyrin interacting partners have been identified that tie gephyrin function-
ally to cytoskeletal transport and anchoring processes (Fig. 3). Key gephyrin associ-
ated proteins identified so far include: the cdc42 guanylate exchange factor (GEF) 
collybistin (100), tubulin (178), the motor protein component dynein light chain 
(Dlc) (71), Mena/VASP (75), profilin (143) and RAFT (187). Gephyrin binding to 
tubulin provides a physical linkage between gephyrin and microtubules. Gephyrin 
also interacts directly with the actin monomer binding proteins profilin I and profilin 
II, and the actin microfilament adaptors Mena and VASP, providing a link to the 
actin cytoskeleton (5, 75, 143). Gephyrin can form complexes with profilin and 
Mena dependent on the gephyrin E-domain and competes with G-actin and phos-
pholipids for the same binding region on profilin (75). In cell lines or cultured hippo-
campal neurons, profilin and Mena/VASP partially colocalize with inhibitory synap-
tic markers and gephyrin clusters and may contribute to a link between gephyrin 
dependent receptor clustering mechanisms and the microfilament system to regulate 
the dynamics of receptor localization at inhibitory synapses (163). 
 
Of particular interest was the identification by yeast two-hybrid screening of a 
direct interaction of gephyrin with guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) colly-
bistin (hPEM-2 in humans), which can accelerate the GDP-GTP exchange on small 
GTPases (100). Collybistin is a member of the Dbl family of GEFs which are com-
posed of tandem Dbl-homology (DH) and pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains and 
are specific for the Rho GTPases (Cdc42, Rac and Rho and their isoforms) which 
can regulate, among other processes, the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. 
Collybistin exists in a number of splice variants with three alternatively spliced C-
terminal isoforms combined with presence or absence of an N-terminal SH3 domain. 
Collybistin 2 (the shortest version) recruits gephyrin to submembranous clusters 
which recruit glycine receptors (89, 100). Collybistin is a selective GEF for the 
GTPase Cdc42, which can regulate the reorganization of actin filaments. Since 
gephyrin can interact with components of the cytoskeleton, collybistin may regulate 
gephyrin function and receptor clustering by controlling local actin dynamics around 
the gephyrin lattice. Recent structural and biochemical results indicate that gephyrin 
binding has an inhibitory function on collybistin GEF activity (235). Collybistin may 
therefore play a role in terminating Cdc42 signaling during the initial stages of in-"

hibitory synapse formation. In addition to control of cytoskeletal dynamics, the abil-
ity of gephyrin to associate with mTOR/RAFT1 (rapamycin and FKB12 target pro-
tein) suggests that gephyrin may also be able to participate in translational control at 
the synapse (187). This is in line with the demonstration that glycine receptor alpha 
subunit mRNAs can be found localized in the vicinity of the postsynaptic membrane 
(183) where a protein synthesis machinery is also present (74). 
 
Gephyrin also interacts with dynein light chain 1 (also known as dynein light 
chain 8) and its homologue dynein light chain 2 (71). Dynein light chain interacts 
with a 63 amino acid binding domain within the central linker region of gephyrin and 
this interaction allows the recruitment of gephyrin and glycine receptors to dynein 
motor complexes for retrograde transport in neurons (71, 140). Whether gephyrin 
can similarly recruit GABAA receptor complexes to dynein motors remains un-
known. 
9.4 Functional Role of Gephyrin in Regulating the Formation and 
Maintenance of Inhibitory Glycinergic and GABAergic Synapses 
Evidence supports a role for gephyrin in regulating the formation of inhibitory syn-
apses and the recruitment of receptors to these postsynaptic specializations. Loss of 
function studies using antisense or gephyrin KO mice (104) (65, 104, 132) demon-
strated that this protein is essential for the synaptic recruitment and/or clustering of 
all synaptic glycine receptors, both in the brain and spinal cord. Furthermore, gephy-
rin knockout mice die soon after birth, exhibiting a rigid hyperextended posture 
similar to animals treated with strychnine. In contrast the consequences of gephyrin 
depletion on the function of GABAergic synapses have remained more controversial. 
Antisense treatment against gephyrin in cultured hippocampal neurons causes a 
dramatic reduction in the density of clusters for GABAA receptor α2 and γ2 subunits 
(61). Similarly RNAi mediated gephyrin knockdown resulted in a significant reduc-
tion but did not completely abolish the clustering of α2 and γ2 containing GABAA 
receptors (94). A complete absence of α2 and γ2 containing clusters in hippocampal 
cultures from gephyrin knockout mice was reported in one study (117). In contrast 
other studies have shown that, whereas surface and synaptic clusters of α2 and γ2 
subunit containing GABAA receptors are significantly reduced, many clusters could 
still be detected, and furthermore α1 subunit clusters remain unaffected in gephyrin 
knockout neurons (116, 131, 132). Therefore in most neuronal types, gephyrin is not 
essential for GABAA receptor clustering but does appear to contribute to the aggre-
gation of α2, α3 and γ2 but not α1 or α5 subunits. In agreement with this, GABAer-
gic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), although reduced in ampli-
tude, are present in hippocampal neurons lacking gephyrin, suggesting that gephyrin 
independent mechanisms of GABAA receptor clustering exist and may compensate 
during inhibitory synapse development in the absence of gephyrin (132).  
 
Intriguingly, the clustering of gephyrin at GABAergic synapses is dependent on 
GABAA receptors. Gephyrin does not form clusters in the absence of GABAA recep-
tors in cultured neurons and gephyrin clustering is disrupted in vivo
GABAA receptor α1, α3 and γ2 subunit knockout mice (2, 61, 125, 207). For exam-
ple, in α3 knockout neurons of the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the absence of 
 in neurons from"

GABAA receptors results in gephyrin forming large intracellular aggregates rather 
than synaptic clusters (207). Similarly in α1 knockout mice gephyrin clustering at 
postsynaptic sites is disrupted, leading to intracellular aggregates (125). In agreement 
with these results, artificial aggregation of GABAA receptors induces co-clustering 
of gephyrin (132). These results suggest that clustered synaptic GABAA receptors 
may recruit gephyrin to synapses. Interestingly, the glycinergic or GABAergic mixed 
phenotype of the presynaptic element determines the postsynaptic accumulation of 
specific cognate receptors but not of gephyrin and the postsynaptic accumulation of 
gephyrin alone cannot account for the formation of glycine receptor rich microdo-
mains (130). A developmental analysis revealed that, at mixed glycine-GABAergic 
synapses, GABAA receptors formed clusters first, followed by gephyrin and then by 
glycine receptors (57). Gephyrin may then form a submembranous lattice that could 
serve to further stabilize newly recruited GABAA receptors at these sites. In agree-
ment with this notion, RNAi mediated gephyrin knockdown combined with fluores-
cence imaging of GFP-labeled GABAA receptors found that gephyrin regulates 
GABAA receptor cell surface dynamics by reducing the mobility of GABAA receptor 
clusters (94). This would provide a feedback loop to promote and validate the forma-
tion of inhibitory postsynaptic specializations. 
9.5 GRIP1 
The glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) is one of the few proteins to be 
found enriched at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (52, 53). GRIP1 and its 
homologue GRIP2 are 7 PDZ domain containing proteins originally identified to 
interact with glutamate receptors. In addition, a second GRIP family member, ABP 
(for AMPA receptor binding protein) is a shorter splice variant derived from the 
same gene as GRIP2 but lacking the seventh PDZ domain. GRIP1 is encoded by a 
separate gene which can produce several GRIP1 isoforms by alternative splicing 
(GRIP1a, GRIP1b and GRIP1c4-7) (31, 32). GRIP1 associates with several proteins 
including the C-termini of AMPA receptor GluR2/3 and 4c subunits, ephrins and 
Eph receptors, the proteoglycan NG2, the putative extracellular matrix (ECM) pro-
tein Fraser syndrome protein (Fras1), GRASPs (for GRIP associated proteins) and 
liprin α family members (32, 52, 53, 205, 213, 233, 237). This suggests that GRIP 
may be important for regulating the function of other proteins in addition to gluta-
mate receptors and has a more general role in membrane transport processes. In 
addition GRIP1 associates with several signaling molecules and proteins implicated 
in cytoskeletal transport processes including kinesin motor proteins and the micro-
tubule associated protein GABARAP. Surprisingly, several groups have reported that 
GRIP1 associates with the postsynaptic domains of inhibitory synapses. Im-
munofluorescence experiments in cultured neurons and brain slices reveal that 
GRIP-1 and the 4-PDZ domain splice form GRIP-1c (PDZ 4-7) co-localize with 
several inhibitory postsynaptic markers such as gephyrin and GABAA receptors (27, 
32, 53, 135) (234). Furthermore, using immunoelectron microscopy, GRIP1 was 
found to localize at inhibitory synapses in intact brain where it localizes to both the 
presynaptic and postsynaptic side of inhibitory synapses (31). The role of GRIP-1 at 
inhibitory synapses remains unknown, although its ability to interact with cytoskeletal"

10 Cell Adhesion Molecules at the Inhibitory Synapse 
The exact mechanisms that underlie the precise alignment of presynaptic terminals 
from innervating neurons with postsynaptic domains containing the cognate neuro-
transmitter receptor remain unclear. It has become clear however that in addition to 
postsynaptic scaffold proteins a critical role also exists for cell adhesion molecules 
that can span the synapse linking pre- and postsynaptic membranes. Several cell ad-
hesion molecules such as cadherins (10), the dystroglycan complex and neur-
exin/neuroligin complexes have been localized to inhibitory synapses and proposed 
to play an important role in their formation and maintenance (Fig. 2). 
10.1 Neurexins and Neuroligins: Key Molecules for the Induction 
The neuroligins, and their presynaptic counterparts neurexins, have emerged as key 
trans-synaptic organizing molecules at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. 
Neurexins were originally identified as a binding partner for the black widow spider 
venom α-latrotoxin (223). Using biochemical techniques, a number of endogenous 
neurexin binding partners were then identified such as neuroligins, neurexophilins 
and dystroglycan (46). The most well characterized neurexin complex is that with 
neuroligins. Neurexins and neuroligins form cell adhesion complexes that span the 
synaptic cleft, with neurexins localized on the presynaptic side and the neuroligins 
located in the postsynaptic domain (46) (see Chapter by El-Husseini, this volume). A 
key role of the neurexin/neuroligin complex for generating synaptic connections 
became clear when it was shown that neuroligins expressed in a human embryonic 
kidney (HEK) cell line could induce glutamatergic axons from co-cultured neurons 
to form functional release sites onto these non-neuronal cells (191). In a complemen-
tary set of co-culture experiments, it was also found that when neurexins were ex-
pressed alone on non-neuronal cells they could trigger postsynaptic differentiation 
and clustering of postsynaptic receptors and scaffolds in contacting dendrites (79). 
 
Neurexins are cell surface proteins that contain a large extracellular N-terminal 
domain, transmembrane region and short intracellular C-terminus. There are three 
vertebrate genes for Neurexins that contain two independent promoters, which allow 
the formation of either α- or (the shorter) β-neurexins. Neurexins can be alternatively 
spliced at five different sites allowing for the expression of hundreds of alternatively 
spliced isoforms (46). The N-terminal domain of α-neurexins contains six laminin-
neurexin-sex hormone-binding globulin (LNS) domains interspersed by three EGF-
like regions whereas β-neurexins contain only a single LNS domain. Neurexins have 
relatively short intracellular domains which bind to synaptotagmin and the PDZ 
domains of CASK, syntenin and Mint linking them to synaptic vesicles and the vesi-
cle fusion machinery (46). Extracellularly, α- and β-neurexins bind to neuroligins, 
of Inhibitory Synapses 
 
and trafficking proteins suggest that it may be involved in the regulation of GABAA 
receptor function or trafficking (105)."

which are concentrated in the postsynaptic domains of inhibitory and excitatory 
synapses.  
 
There are believed to be at least four main neuroligin isoforms in mammals 
(NLGN1-NLGN4). Neuroligins comprise a large extracellular domain similar in 
structure to that of acetylcholinesterase (but lacking cholinesterase activity), which 
interacts with neurexins. In addition, neuroligins can homo-multimerise through their 
AChE-like domain. In contrast to their large extracellular domains, the intracellular 
domains of neuroligins are relatively short and terminate with a PDZ domain ligand. 
The PDZ domain ligand is believed to link them to several PDZ domain containing 
postsynaptic proteins such as PSD-95 and S-SCAM family members in addition to 
Shank, PICK1, GOPC and SPAR (46, 152). The identification of protein interactions 
between neuroligins and components of the excitatory postsynaptic scaffold sug-
gested a mechanism allowing them to co-ordinate the formation of excitatory syn-
apses. However, the importance of neuroligins for the formation of inhibitory syn-
apses was suggested when it was reported that neuroligin-2 is enriched at inhibitory 
(but not excitatory) synapses (225). 
 
Substantial evidence has now accumulated to support the ability of neurexin-
neuroligin complexes to trigger presynaptic/postsynaptic differentiation and/or stabi-
lization of inhibitory synapses. Graf et al. (2004) showed that neurexin presented 
alone on the surface of HEK cells or on beads is sufficient to induce the localized 
clustering of glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic receptors and scaffolds 
(79). They also went on to demonstrate that, whereas neuroligins-1, -3 and -4 local-
ize to excitatory postsynaptic domains, neuroligin-2 localizes primarily to inhibitory 
synapses supporting the idea that neuroligin-2 is a key factor for the differentiation 
of inhibitory synapses. In agreement with this, aggregating neuroligins-1, -3 and -4 
resulted in clustering of only excitatory postsynaptic components, whereas aggregat-
ing neuroligin-2 resulted in redistribution of both excitatory and inhibitory postsy-
naptic proteins. Although it is now well established that neuroligin-2 can selectively 
link gephyrin and GABAA receptors, the mechanisms of this linkage remain unclear. 
Importantly, the presynaptic contacts induced by neuroligins appear to exhibit many 
of the release characteristics of normal synapses. This has most recently been ele-
gantly demonstrated by experiments showing that HEK cells co-expressing  
neuroligins with either AMPA receptors or GABAA receptors and co-cultured with 
neurons produce miniature excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic like currents 
(mIPSCs or mEPSCs) (54, 70). 
 
Additional functional evidence for a critical role of neuroligins comes from RNA 
interference studies which showed that knockdown of neuroligins-1, -3 in hippocam-
pal cultures reduced the density of inhibitory and excitatory synapses identified by 
immunofluorescence with inhibitory and excitatory presynaptic markers (38). Fur-
thermore knockdown also resulted in a large reduction in the amplitude and fre-
quency of mIPSCs. The synaptogenic activity of neurexins/neuroligins appears to be 
in part dependent on alternative splicing in splice site B of the neuroligin AChE-
domain and at site 4 in β-neurexins. It has been proposed that neuroligin lacking a 
splice insert in splice B together with β-neurexins containing an S4 insert selectively 
promote differentiation of GABAergic synapses, whereas β-neurexins lacking S4 but"

10.2 Dystrophin Glycoprotein Complex (DGC) 
There are accumulating localization and functional studies suggesting that the dys-
trophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), which in non-neuronal cells links the extracel-
lular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton, is another adhesion complex important 
for the proper maturation and function of a subset of inhibitory synapses. The DGC 
is a large complex containing at least 10 proteins (e.g. dystrophin, dystroglycan, 
utrophin, syntrophins, sarcoglycans and dystrobrevins) (12). Dystroglycan is a major 
component of the DGC and is composed of an extracellular α-subunit and trans-
membrane β-subunit, both derived from proteolytic cleavage of a single pre-cursor 
protein, and which remain bound to each other on the cell surface. Through its ex-
tracellular domain dystroglycan binds matrix proteins agrin, laminin and perlcan and 
the presynaptic proteins neurexins. Through its intracellular domain dystroglycan 
binds dystrophin (a large > 400 kDa cytoskeletal protein of the α-actinin/β-spectrin 
family) and utrophin (12). Dystrophin interacts directly with dystrobrevins, syntro-
phin and the actin cytoskeleton. Mutations in dystrophin result in Duchene and 
Becker muscular dystrophies in humans. Similarly, mutations in many of the genes 
encoding components of the DGC (e.g. α-, β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan, α-dystrobrevin, 
laminin α2, and four enzymes that glycosylate dystroglycan) lead to muscular dys-
trophies in human or animal models (12). 
 
containing splice insert B selectively promote differentiation of glutamatergic syn-
apses (19, 39, 46). 
 
It had generally been assumed that postsynaptic neuroligins interact trans-
synaptically with presynaptic neurexins. Using immunoelectron microscopy, it was 
revealed that in addition to being localized pre-synaptically, neurexins were also 
found to be abundantly expressed in the postsynaptic density suggesting that cis-
neurexin-neuroligin complexes may also form postsynaptically (214). Furthermore 
cis-expression of recombinant neurexin was found to block the synaptogenic activity 
of neuroligin-1. Postsynaptic cis-interactions between neuroligins and neurexins 
could provide a novel mechanism for silencing the activity of trans-synaptic com-
plexes. Whether postsynaptic expression of neurexins can also mediate an inhibitory 
effect on synaptogenic activity of neuroligin-2 at inhibitory synapses remains un-
clear. However, these recent findings suggest a mechanism for silencing neuroligin 
function to regulate synapse formation or disassembly (214). 
 
The increase in synapse formation observed in vitro by neuroligins and neurexins 
has been proposed to be due to the synaptogenic activity promoting the differentia-
tion of new synapses. In contrast, in vivo although neuroligin function appears essen-
tial for synaptic function and animal survival it does not appear to be required for 
synapse formation per se (46, 224). Recent work reconciling these apparently con-
tradictory observations suggests that rather than inducing the differentiation of new 
synapses, neurexin/neuroligin complexes act to specify and validate already formed 
synapses by an activity-dependent mechanism (42). In this model, activity-dependent 
postsynaptic signaling mechanisms converge on either neuroligin-1 or neuroligin-2 
to validate the formation of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses, respectively (42)."

A number of studies support a role for the DGC at inhibitory synapses (26, 119, 
120, 131). Several groups have localized components of the DGC (including α- 
and β-dystroglycan, long and short forms of dystrophin, syntrophin and α- and β-
dystrobrevin) to a subset of inhibitory synapses on neuronal somata and dendrites 
(131). Although the role of the DGC at inhibitory synapses remains unclear, the 
demonstration that dystrophin mutant mdx mice or DGC knockout mice have a 
large reduction in GABAA receptor clusters (but not gephyrin) has lead to the pro-
posal that the DGC may be important for regulating the stability of GABAA recep-
tors at DGC containing synapses (120). More recently, cerebellar Purkinje cells 
from double α- and β-dystrobrevin knockout mice have been found to have de-
pleted synaptic dystrophin levels, reduced GABAA receptor clusters and altered 
sensorimotor behaviors similar to those seen in dystrophin-deficient (mdx) mice 
suggesting that other DGC components in addition to dystrophin can affect inhibi-
tory synaptic structure (78). In addition, observations of the critical requirement 
for the DGC for the proper maturation and function of a subset of inhibitory cere-
bellar synapses suggests that the motor deficits observed in muscular dystrophy 
patients may reflect not only peripheral dysfunctions but in addition alterations of 
synaptic inhibition in the CNS (78). 
 
The major extracellular matrix components that bind the DGC in non-neuronal 
cells (laminin, perlecan, collagen and agrin) are not as abundant in brain and the 
extracellular space between neurons in adult brain lacks a basal lamina. This sug-
gests that other neuro-specific ligands of the DGC may exist. In agreement with 
this it has been demonstrated that in brain, the DGC forms a stoichiometric com-
plex with the presynaptic neurexins (210). Both α- and β-neurexin can interact 
with dystroglycan via the second and sixth LNS domain of α-neurexin and the 
single LNS domain in β-neurexin, suggesting that they may be the main neuronal 
DGC receptors. Intriguingly, in a hippocampal cell culture model of inhibitory 
synapse formation, gephyrin and GABAARs can be mistargeted to glutamatergic 
terminals when there is insufficient inhibitory presynaptic terminal innervation 
(41, 184, 208). In contrast, components of the DGC are not mistargeted to gluta-
matergic synapses due to reduced inhibitory presynaptic input or in the absence of 
GABAA receptor γ2 subunits suggesting independent targeting mechanisms which 
may rely on interaction with specific presynaptic neurexins present at inhibitory 
synapses (26, 210). Recently it has been demonstrated that the synaptic scaffolding 
molecule S-SCAM can be found localized to inhibitory synapses (211). S-SCAM 
contains 5 or 6 PDZ domains, a guanylate kinase domain and two WW domains. 
S-SCAM can interact with β-dystroglycan via its WW domains and neuroligin-2 
via its WW domains and second PDZ domain. Furthermore, S-SCAM, β-
dystroglycan and neuroligin-2 form a tripartite complex 
immunoprecipitate from rat brain and partially co-localize in rat hippocampal 
neurons. These results suggest that S-SCAM functions as a linker between the 
DGC/neurexin complex and the neuroligin/neurexin complex.

11 Membrane Trafficking and Dynamics of GABAA Receptors 
and Glycine Receptors  
Although postsynaptic specializations can be viewed as relatively fixed entities, the 
individual components of the inhibitory postsynaptic domain themselves are dy-
namic. The number of surface and synaptic GABA and glycine receptors is deter-
mined by rates of receptor cycling between surface and intracellular compartments 
and the exchange of synaptic and extrasynaptic surface receptors. This is determined 
by association with receptor associated proteins that regulates exocytosis and endo-
cytosis of plasma membrane receptors and also by the relationship of receptors with 
their associated scaffold proteins. 
11.1 GABAA Receptor Associated Proteins in Receptor Transport, 
Localization, and Internalization 
Given the selective cellular localization of GABAA receptors and glycine receptors, it 
is clear that the trafficking, targeting and clustering of these receptors is a tightly 
controlled and regulated process. A number of GABAA receptor associated proteins 
that interact directly with GABAA receptor intracellular domains have been recently 
implicated in receptor membrane trafficking and localization (Fig. 4). Several of 
these proteins are not highly enriched at inhibitory synapses, but rather are thought to 
be important for receptor transport and maturation throughout the secretory pathway 
(see Chapter by Hanus and Ehlers, this volume). GABAA receptor α- and β-subunits 
are components of essentially all native GABAA receptors and play key roles in 
controlling receptor trafficking. Several proteins interact with the intracellular do-
mains of these receptors. The ubiquitin related protein Plic-1 interacts with GABAA 
receptor α- and β-subunits (8). Plic-1 is a 67 kDa protein with a ubiquitin like N-
terminal (UBL) domain and a carboxy-terminal ubiquitin associated domain (UBA) 
(113). Plic proteins regulate ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in the protea-
some by their ability to bind ubiquitin ligases and components of the proteasome 
(113) (see Chapter by Helton and Ehlers, this volume). Yeast two hybrid screens and 
GST affinity purification assays have shown that Plic-1 interacts with all α (1–6) and 
β (1–3) subunits of GABAA receptors indicating that Plic-1 function may be relevant 
for the majority of GABAA receptor subtypes expressed in the brain (8). Im-
munofluorescence studies found Plic-1 to be mainly expressed in intracellular com-
partments and not at synapses (8). Significantly, a number of GABAA receptors 
colocalize with Plic-1 beneath the plasma membrane at subsynaptic membranes (8). 
Interestingly binding to the intracellular loops of α and β subunits is mediated by the 
UBA domain of Plic-1 and functional studies in non-neuronal HEK293 cells and 
hippocampal brain slices revealed that blockade of the interaction between Plic-1 and 
GABAA receptors results in reduced receptor cell surface expression (8). Consistent 
with these results, overexpression of Plic-1 in recombinant systems results in an 
increase in surface expressed GABAA receptors without affecting internalization 
rates (8). Plic-1 may thus act to modulate GABAA receptor cell surface numbers by 
inhibiting receptor degradation in the proteasome, providing initial evidence that 
GABAA receptor function and synaptic receptor number may be regulated by ubiq-"

uitin dependent degradation processes. The role of ubiquitination in regulating gly-
cine receptor surface stability and membrane trafficking has also been demonstrated, 
however, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process remain unknown (28). 
 
 
 
Fig. 4. Trafficking of GABAA receptors. 
Assembled GABAA receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum are delivered to the 
Golgi, possibly with aid of the guanidine exchange factor BIG2. GABARAP can 
associate with the intracellular loop of the γ2 subunit in the Golgi as well as with 
NSF, which may facilitate transportation of the receptor complexes to the cell sur-
face. In addition the ubiquitin like protein Plic-1 is localized in intracellular com-
partments where it binds α and β subunits. This interaction is thought to regulate 
membrane targeting by preventing degradation in the proteasome. GABAA receptors 
inserted at extrasynaptic sites can diffuse along the plasma membrane into postsy-
naptic sites where they are stabilized by an undefined interaction with the scaffolding 
protein gephyrin. GABAA receptors are internalized via clathrin mediated pathway, 
where GABAA receptors move out of synaptic sites and are recruited to clathrin pits 
by the association of β and γ subunits with the clathrin adaptor protein AP2. The 
large GTPase dynamin releases the clathrin-coated vesicle which delivers the inter-
nalized receptor to the endosomal system. In early endosomes, GABAA receptors can 
be targeted for degradation or recycle back to the plasma membrane, a process that is 
mediated by an interaction with the Huntingtin associated protein HAP1."

The guanine nucleotide exchange factor BIG2 (brefeldin A-inhibited GDP/GTP 
exchange factor 2) has also been identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a GABAA 
receptor β subunit interacting protein (33). BIG2 is mainly found concentrated in the 
trans Golgi network although a small proportion is found in vesicle-like structures 
along dendrites and near post-synaptic sites (33). BIG2 has previously been impli-
cated in vesicular transport by its ability to catalyse the GDP-GTP exchange on ARF 
GTPases. Interestingly, coexpression of BIG2 with the GABAA receptor β3 subunit 
results in an increase in β3 exit from the ER suggesting that BIG2 is involved in the 
post-Golgi vesicular trafficking of GABAA receptors (33). Other GABAA receptor β-
subunit interacting proteins that have been identified include GRIF-1 (6) and gC1qR 
(190) whereas radixin has been shown to interact with receptor α-subunits (136). 
Neither GRIF-1 nor gC1qR have been found enriched at synapses and their func-
tional significance remains to be established. The ERM family member radixin was 
identified by yeast two hybrid to interact with extrasynaptic GABAA receptor α5 
subunits. Radixin’s ability to bind to actin suggests that it may act to link GABAA 
receptors to the actin cytoskeleton and to the formation of extrasynaptic α5 subunit 
containing GABAA receptors (136). 
 
As outlined above, the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit is essential for the synaptic 
localization, clustering and function of GABAA receptors. Several yeast two hybrid 
screens using the γ2 subunit have identified γ2 subunit associated proteins that are 
important for the selective synaptic targeting mediated by this subunit. The first to be 
identified was the 17 kDa GABAA receptor associated protein (GABARAP), which 
participates in the trafficking of GABAA receptors (226). GABARAP binds γ sub-
copy studies revealed that it is not found at inhibitory synapses but instead colocal-
izes with GABAA receptors in intracellular compartments, namely at the Golgi 
compartment and subsynaptic cisternae (109, 226). GABARAP is a member of a 
family of homologous small microtubule binding proteins that also includes 
GABARAP like1 (GBRL1, GEC1), GABARAP like 2 (GBRL2, GATE-16) and the 
light chain-3A and B (LC3A, LC3B) subunits of MAP-1A and 1B (226). 
GABARAP is able to bind microtubules as well as N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor 
(NSF) supporting a role for GABARAP in GABAA receptor intracellular transport 
(109, 169, 226). Recent immunochemical and electrophysiological studies have 
provided evidence to support a functional role for GABARAP in the trafficking of 
GABAA receptors to the plasma membrane and in inhibitory synaptic plasticity. 
Coexpression of GABARAP and GABAA receptors in COS-7 cells and neurons 
results in an increase in the levels of GABAA receptors expressed at the cell surface 
as well as an increase of GABA mediated currents in oocytes (36, 37, 129). Several 
GABARAP associated proteins have been identified that may also be important for 
GABAA receptor function. Although GABARAP itself is not localized to inhibitory 
strated that two other proteins localized to inhibitory postsynaptic domains, GRIP-1 
and gephyrin interact with GABARAP, suggesting that GABARAP may be impor-
tant for the transport of other components of the inhibitory postsynaptic domain in 
addition to GABAA receptors (105, 118). GABARAP has also been shown to associ-
ate with the phospholipase-C related inactive protein type 1 (PRIP-1). PRIP-1 ap-
units both in vitro and in vivo. Immunocytochemical and immunoelectron micros-
synaptic domains, yeast two hybrid screens and in vitro binding studies have demon-"

pears to compete with the γ2 subunit for GABARAP binding (95). Interestingly 
PRIP-1 knockout mice showed an impairment in GABAA receptor modulation by γ2 
selective pharmacological agents suggesting that PRIP-1 plays a role in the regula-
tion of GABAA receptor trafficking by GABARAP ensuring that only mature αβγ 
receptors are delivered to the plasma membrane (95, 156). Gene deletion studies 
GABAA receptors. However whether this is due to compensation by the other closely 
related GABARAP family members remains to be established (170). 
 
In addition to GABARAP, γ2 subunits have also been identified by yeast two 
hybrid to interact with the Golgi-specific palmitoyl transferase GODZ and to co-
localize with this protein in Golgi compartments (63, 97). The γ2 subunit is the only 
GABAA receptor subunit family member that contains cysteine residues within its 
intracellular domain which have been shown to serve as substrates for palmitoyla-
tion, a post-translational modification important for correct surface delivery and 
synaptic targeting of GABAA receptors (63, 97, 185). GODZ is the major palmitoy-
lating enzyme for GABAA receptors and RNAi mediated knockdown of this protein 
disrupts the formation of normal whole cell and synaptic inhibitory currents. Palmi-
toylation of GABAA receptor γ2 subunits by GODZ (and to a lesser extent by a 
GODZ paralogue, SERZ beta) therefore is important for receptor transport through 
the Golgi apparatus and the selective formation and normal function of inhibitory 
synapses (63, 97). Other GABAA receptor subunits, including γ1, γ3, θ, ε and π also 
contain cysteine residues within their intracellular domains, although whether they 
are substrates for palmitoylation remains to be addressed.  
 
The internalization of GABAA receptors from the cell surface by clathrin and 
dynamin dependent mechanisms has also been demonstrated to be an important 
mechanism for regulating surface and synaptic receptor number (108). GABAA re-
ceptors have been found localized to clathrin coated pits and receptor β- and γ- sub-
units can interact directly with the clathrin adaptor protein AP2 which facilitates the 
recruitment of these receptors into the endocytic pathway (107). The interaction of 
GABAA receptor β-subunits with AP2 has been mapped to a phospho-dependent 
basic amino acid motif that also contains the major site for β-subunit phosphoryla-
tion (106). Blocking GABAA receptor internalization, by either targeting dynamin 
function or by blocking GABAA receptor phospho-dependent interaction with AP2 
inhibits dopaminergic modulation of inhibitory synapse strength in the striatum sug-
gesting that signaling dependent alterations in AP2-dependent GABAA receptor 
endocytosis may be a critical mechanism underlying functional modulation of inhibi-
tion (34). Internalized GABAA receptors can be either targeted for degradation in the 
lysosome or rapidly recycled in a process that is dependent on a direct interaction 
(also identified by yeast two hybrid) of GABAA receptors with the huntingtin associ-
ated protein 1 (HAP1) (110). Interestingly, decreasing HAP1 levels in the hypo-
thalamus using siRNA leads to reduced levels and activity of GABAA receptors and 
altered feeding suggesting that HAP1 dependent GABAA receptor trafficking may 
underlie important aspects of normal animal behavior (110, 196).

11.2 Glycine Receptor Associated Proteins 
With the exception of gephyrin (see above), virtually no proteins have yet been dem-
onstrated to interact directly with glycine receptor subunits. It remains to be tested 
whether any of the identified GABAA receptor associated proteins may also be im-
portant for glycine receptor function and membrane trafficking (analogous to the 
overlapping role of gephyrin for regulating both these Cys-loop receptors). Interest-
ingly, gephyrin itself has been implicated in receptor transport and trafficking in 
addition to its well characterized role in receptor anchoring at the synapse (60, 86, 
115). Gephyrin associates with the vesicular compartments used for intracellular 
trafficking of glycine receptors and has also been demonstrated to act as a mediator 
of microtubule-dependent insertion of newly synthesized receptor molecules into the 
plasma membrane (86). It has also been suggested that non-synaptic glycine recep-
tor/gephyrin complexes can be recruited to microtubules by dynein motors for retro-
grade transport along neuronal processes (115), and diffusing extrasynaptic receptors 
could also bind gephyrin (60). The demonstration of intracellular and extrasynaptic 
glycine receptor/gephyrin complexes suggests a dual function for gephyrin in both 
trafficking and assembly of postsynaptic scaffolds, as has similarly been suggested 
for proteins of excitatory synapses (218). Whether gephyrin also plays a role in the 
intracellular transport of GABAA receptors remains to be determined. 
11.3 Diffusional Properties of Cell Surface GABAA Receptors  
and Glycine Receptors 
Lateral diffusion within the plane of the plasma membrane has been demonstrated 
for both GABAA receptors and glycine receptors. This concept has been extended to 
almost all excitatory and inhibitory receptors so far studied (see Chapter by Choquet 
and Triller, this volume). The best estimates of inhibitory receptor diffusion rates in 
the plasma membrane have been derived from single particle tracking (SPT) of gly-
cine receptors labeled with antibodies to extracellular domains (48, 150). These 
studies have shown that receptor movements display interspersed periods of high and 
low diffusion rates in the extrasynaptic and synaptic membrane, respectively. 
Whereas periods of fast diffusion correspond to Brownian movement, those of slow 
mobility result from transient association of glycine receptor with clusters of gephy-
rin. This association, which reduces diffusion coefficients from up to 0.5 μm2 s-1 to 
less than 0.01 μm2 s–1, imposes a restricted area of exploration (confinement) similar 
to that generated for other proteins by insertion into lipid rafts or by contact with 
protein fences or obstacles. The fact that glycine receptors are not irreversibly re-
tained in gephyrin domains suggests that any postsynaptic cluster of gephyrin can 
behave as donor and/or acceptor for glycine receptors (219). The diffusion rates of 
synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors have not yet been directly measured. 
However, studies using electrophysiologically tagged GABAA receptors indicate that 
significant lateral mobility of GABAA receptors in the plasma membrane also occurs 
(217). Furthermore, combined imaging of GFP-tagged GABAA receptors and RNAi-
mediated gephyrin knockdown demonstrate that synaptic GABAA receptors have 
lower levels of lateral mobility than their extrasynaptic counterparts and that gephy-"

rin plays a specific role in limiting receptor diffusion (94). The dynamic properties of 
gephyrin interactions with glycine receptors and GABAA receptors is therefore also a 
means whereby the number of synaptic receptors can be regulated. Therefore, the 
interactions between receptors and scaffold molecules is likely to be one of the tar-
gets for the regulation of receptors at inhibitory synapses during synaptogenesis and 
in synaptic plasticity, or in homeostatic mechanisms setting the level of inhibition. 
12 Concluding Remarks 
Since their initial identification some two decades ago, significant progress has been 
made in our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the biology of inhibitory 
ligand-gated neurotransmitter receptors. Now that all subunits are cloned, we have a 
clear picture of the extent of receptor subunit heterogeneity and their specific re-
gional and temporal expression profiles in the brain and spinal cord. In addition, a 
detailed picture of the assembly mechanisms that specify the formation of native 
receptor subunit combinations and the molecular mechanisms underlying recognition 
of receptors by agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators has emerged. Molecu-
lar, biochemical, structural and genetic approaches have significantly contributed to 
developing an in depth understanding of the mechanisms that underlie gephyrin-
dependent recruitment and clustering of GABA and glycine receptors to inhibitory 
synapses. More recently the critical role of neuroligin family cell adhesion molecules 
for receptor clustering and the formation and validation of inhibitory synaptic sites 
has also become apparent. Finally, the importance of intracellular membrane traf-
ficking and surface membrane diffusion of receptors has also emerged as a key 
mechanism for regulating the strength and plasticity of inhibitory synapses. Much 
work lies ahead in establishing a detailed model of how the varying processes of 
receptor membrane dynamics and the structural establishment of inhibitory postsy-
naptic domains are coordinated, both during development and in the adult, to under-
lie the formation and synaptic remodeling of inhibitory synapses. Another challenge 
is to understand potential cross talk in the processes regulating excitatory and inhibi-
tory receptors in a same cell. An in depth understanding of how these processes may 
be altered could shed new light on neurological diseases where homeostatic regula-
tion of synaptic inhibition and excitation may be dysregulated.

Acid-Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) and pH in Synapse 
Physiology 
University of Iowa, Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine 
Abstract. Although brain pH is tightly controlled, it can be more dynamic than commonly 
appreciated. Physiological fluctuations in extracellular pH provide ample opportunity for 
protons to influence synaptic signaling. A number of synaptic proteins are modified by 
extracellular pH. Of these, the acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) are gated by extracellular 
protons and thus they may be particularly well suited to respond to synaptic pH. Here we 
review extracellular pH changes that accompany neural activity, the synaptic localization of 
ASICs, and their known effects on synapse function. Results from manipulating ASICs in 
mice suggest important roles for synaptic ASICs in behavior and neurological disease. 
1 Introduction 
In general, the brain’s extracellular pH is controlled within a narrow range (1). 
However, neural activity causes pH alterations that can vary in location and with 
time. In addition, disease can generate sustained deviations of physiologic pH. Here, 
we consider some of the changes in brain pH, and some possible molecular targets, 
focusing particularly on the acid sensing ion channels.  
2 Extracellular pH at the Synapse 
2.1 Proton Release During Neurotransmission Lowers Synaptic pH 
Vacuolar-H+ATPases pump protons into synaptic vesicles lowering vesicle pH to 
~5.2–5.7 (2–5). The resulting proton gradient energizes neurotransmitter uptake; it 
may also serve an important signaling role during neurotransmission (Fig. 1a). In 
addition to free protons, at low pH other molecules in the vesicle are protonated, 
creating a source of releasable protons. Thus, when synaptic vesicles fuse with the 
presynaptic membrane, free protons and protonated acids are released into the 
synaptic cleft (5). At the release site, pH probably falls very quickly, but the

Acid-Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) and pH in Synapse Physiology

Fig. 1. Model of pH fluctuations at the synapse. (a) Synaptic vesicles release protons and 
neurotransmitter (NT) into the synaptic cleft during neurotransmission, which may lower pH 
in the synaptic cleft and modulate pH sensitive channels and other proteins in the pre- and 
post-synaptic membrane. Illustrated are voltage-gated Ca2+-channels (VGCC), NMDA 
receptors, and ASICs, although other pH sensitive proteins may also be present. Glia, 
metabolism, and disease processes lower interstitial pH and may also affect synaptic pH and 
physiology. (b) At lease three transient pH fluctuations may occur at the synapse in response 
to neural activity. Rapid acidification of the cleft (green) may occur with vesicle release and 
probably lasts milliseconds (ms) or less. A slower alkalosis (blue) has been detected in the 
interstitial space within tens of milliseconds. An even slower acidosis (red) can follow intense 
neural activity and last for seconds. Improved techniques are needed to better characterize the 
degree and duration of these pH fluctuations at the synapse. 
2.3 Intense Neural Activity Causes Acidosis 
On an even slower timescale, intense neural activity produces a wave of acidification 
(Fig. 1b, red waveform)(17). The acidosis occurs within seconds to minutes of 
stimulation and can last for minutes or longer. The degree of acidification and its 
duration appear to depend on the magnitude of neural and metabolic activity. With 
extreme activity, such as during a seizure, interstitial pH can fall well below 7.0; 
raising the chance of both synaptic and extra-synaptic consequences. Metabolic 
mechanisms may contribute to the acidification. Mitochondria take up Ca2+ and 
extrude H+, which in turn can be transported out of the cell (22–24). Lactate is also 
produced and extruded from cells (17). Glia move acid across the cell membrane (28, 
29), and glial extrusion of lactate may provide an important energy source for active"

664 
 
neurons (30). Increased metabolic activity also produces more CO2, which can be 
rapidly hydrated to HCO3
– and H+ (31). The physiological consequences of this 
slower acid transient on synaptic transmission are not clear, although the effects are 
likely to be mainly inhibitory because prolonged acidosis reduces the excitability of 
most central neurons (26). 
2.4 Neurological Disease can Produce Acidosis  
Extracellular acidosis is also associated with several neurological diseases. For 
example, seizures and ischemia are well known to reduce extracellular pH (32–35). 
Inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases, 
such as Huntington’s disease, impair energy metabolism (36, 37). A resulting 
accumulation of lactate may contribute to acidosis. Interestingly, lactic acid is a 
particularly potent activator of some ASIC channels (38, 39). Cortical spreading 
depression, which has been linked to migraine, is also associated with acidosis (32, 
40–42). The acidosis associated with these diseases could readily influence synaptic 
signaling and neuron function. Future challenges include better elucidating the 
mechanisms underlying the pH alterations, and better understanding of the 
physiological and pathophysiological consequences of low pH. At the molecular 
level, pH-sensitive ion channels may mediate, in large part, the physiological effects 
of acidosis and alkalosis at the synapse. 
3 Acid Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) 
3.1 ASICs are Well Suited to Respond to Synaptic pH 
J.A. Wemmie et al. 
A number of synaptic channels are sensitive to pH modulation; including glutamate 
receptors, GABA-receptors, and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (9–15, 43). These ion 
channels likely contribute to the physiological effects of fluctuating extracellular pH 
(9, 44). Unlike these other channels, in which pH modulates the response to a ligand 
or voltage, extracellular protons directly gate acid sensing ion channels (ASICs). 
ASICs are members of the DEG/ENaC family located at synapses where they may 
play an important role in synaptic signaling. They are preferentially permeable to 
Na+, but to a lesser extent can conduct other cations (Ca2+, K+, Li+, H+). Thus, ASICs 
may be well suited to mediate effects of acute pH changes at the synapse.  
3.2 ASICs are Comprised of Multiple Subunits 
Five ASIC subunits have been identified in mammalian neurons: ASIC1a, -1b, -2a, -
2b, and -3, (a and b refer to alternatively spliced isoforms). The ASIC subunits 
combine to form both homomultimeric and heteromultimeric channel complexes 
(45–47). ASIC2b by itself does not form an acid-activated channel, but modifies 
currents from other acid-activated subunits (45). The related proteins, ASIC4 and 
BLINaC, share sequence homology with ASICs, but these mammalian proteins have 
not been shown to produce or modify acid-activated currents (48, 49), although an 
ASIC4 homolog in zebrafish is acid-activated (50). The recently determined crystal"

determined crystal structure of chicken ASIC1a minus portions of the amino- and carboxy-
termini (55). Individual ASIC1a subunits separated by color. 
3.3 Subunit Composition Dictates Channel Properties 
Homomultimeric ASIC channels vary in activation and desensitization kinetics, and in 
pH sensitivity (Fig. 3a). For example, one study reported the half-maximal activation 
(pH0.5) of mouse ASIC subunits as 6.8 (ASIC1a), 6.2 (ASIC1b), 4.9 (ASIC2a), and 6.6 
(ASIC3) (46). Slightly different values have also been reported (47), which may to 
some degree reflect differences between species, for example rat ASIC1a may be less 
sensitive (pH0.5 = 6.2–5.8) (47, 56) than mouse ASIC1a (46). Properties can also vary 
considerably when subunits are co-expressed to form heteromultimers. For example, 
 
structure of ASIC1a indicates a unique trimeric assembly (Fig. 2b), which suggests 
that three subunits are required to form a channel (55). Interestingly, previous studies 
using electrophysiological, biochemical, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer 
approaches had suggested that 4–9 subunits may combine to form a channel (51–54). 
Although the explanation for this difference is unknown, understanding the reason 
for the discrepancy may give the field insight into the structure and function of these 
channels."

ASIC1a homomultimers are permeable to Ca2+, whereas when ASIC1a 
heteromultimerizes with ASIC2a the channel loses Ca2+ permeability (57). Also 
ASIC1a, -2a, and -3 heteromultimers desensitize faster than any of the individual 
subunits alone (Fig. 3) (46, 47). This result indicates that the properties of 
heteromultimeric channels are not simply the sum of properties from the individual 
subunits. Instead, subunits combine to confer new properties on channels.

rate of desensitization. (b) Acid-evoked current in hippocampal neurons cultured from mice of

3.4 ASIC1a is Critical for Acid-Evoked Currents in the Brain 
In the brain, ASIC1a, -2a, and -2b are the most prominently expressed subunits (58–61). 
Of these, ASIC1a plays a critical role. Disrupting the ASIC1a gene eliminates 
current evoked by lowering extracellular pH to 5.0 in cultured hippocampal, cortical, 
and amygdala neurons (Fig. 3b). Conversely, disrupting ASIC2 slightly increased pH 
5-evoked current (Fig. 3b) (61) (65–67). In addition, an antagonist specific for 
ASIC1a homomultimers (PcTx1, from tarantula venom) inhibited a significant 
proportion of the acid-activated current in cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons 
(60, 67, 68). Thus, much of the acid-activated current in the brain is mediated by 
ASIC1a homomultimers and ASIC1a-containing heteromultimers. Consequently, 
relative to the other ASICs, we currently know the most about ASIC1a in the brain.

Acid-Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) and pH in Synapse Physiology
667
 
 
3.5 Fluctuating Brain pH Could Activate or Desensitize ASIC1a 
ASIC1a homomultimeric channels are activated as pH falls below 7.2, with a pH0.5 of 
about 6.8–6.2 (46), (56). This pH sensitivity indicates that ASIC1a is well within the 
range of acidosis recorded during both physiological and pathophysiological states. 
Because ASIC currents are largely transient and densensitize quickly, some have 
considered them best suited to respond to rapid, transient pH fluctuations such as 
those thought to occur at the synapse. However, ASICs can also manifest a persistent 
current (45, 46, 69), particularly when activated in the presence of modulatory 
neuropeptides such as NPFF or FMRFamide (70). Moreover, it is possible that ASIC 
activation could produce sustained effects in second messenger pathways, by raising 
intracellular Ca2+, for example (57, 67, 71). 
 
Another way that pH regulates ASICs is by desensitization; sustained exposure to 
extracellular protons inactivates the channels. Desensitization begins at pH < 8.0 in 
cultured sensory neurons, with half-maximal desensitization occurring at ~pH 7.2 
(Fig. 4) (72). Thus, similar to the NMDA receptor, when extracellular pH is held at 
 
Fig. 4. Extracellular pH regulates ASIC activation and steady-state inactivation (desensiti-
zation). (a) Illustration of desensitization and activation sensitivity to extracellular pH in 
sensory neurons. Desensitization curve represents the effects of variations in sustained pH on 
the subsequent pH 5-evoked current (protocol illustrated in b). Activation curve illustrates 
current evoked by stepping from pH 8 to lower pH levels. Depending on the rate of recovery 
from inactivation, the overlapping area beneath the two curves (blue) could provide a window 
of steady state current; evidence from sensory neurons supports this possibility (68). (b) 
Desensitization protocol. Due to channel desensitization, stepping from pH 7 to pH 5 evokes 
smaller current than stepping from pH 7.4 to pH 5. Similarly, stepping from pH 8 to pH 5 
evokes larger ASIC current. Adapted from (72) with permission."
365,"===== Page 8 =====
668 
 
7.35, a significant proportion of ASIC channels are tonically desensitized. As 
sustained pH becomes more alkaline, desensitization is reduced and transient 
acidosis evokes greater ASIC current. Similarly, as sustained pH falls, 
desensitization increases and transient acidosis evokes smaller ASIC current. These 
dynamic effects of pH raise the possibility that both acid and alkaline pH could 
regulate ASIC activity in vivo. Moreover, the effects of pH on channel activation and 
desensitization could generate seemingly paradoxical effects. For example, a 
generalized alkaline pH might increase the effect of a transient pH drop during 
neurotransmission. The degree of channel activity may also depend on the speed of 
onset, magnitude, and duration of the pH change, as well as the presence of 
modulators in the extracellular milieu (such as FMRFamide (70), Zn2+ (73, 74), 
lactate (38), arachidonic acid (75) and others (62)). However, because of this 
complexity, it is difficult to precisely predict the amount of ASIC channel activity in 
vivo. 
4 ASIC1a Modulates Synapse Physiology 
4.1 ASIC1a is Localized to Central Synapses 
Data from multiple experimental approaches place ASIC1a in dendritic spines. By 
subcellular fractionation, several studies found that ASIC1a is enriched in the 
synaptosome-containing brain fraction, suggesting a synaptic distribution (65, 76, 
77). In cultured neurons, immunohistochemistry also detected endogenous and 
overexpressed ASIC1a protein in dendritic spines (65, 71, 76, 77). These studies also 
revealed ASIC1a to be present at puncta along the dendritic shaft and in the cell body 
(Fig. 5). The improved signal-to-noise ratio obtained from biolistically transfecting 
ASIC1a into organotypic hippocampal slices revealed a clearer picture of the 
protein’s distribution (Fig. 5) (71). Using this method, ASIC1a was visualized in 
almost all dendritic spines, and was clustered in many spine heads. This localization 
pattern places ASIC1a at the postsynaptic membrane, making it a good candidate for 
sensing protons there. 
4.2 ASIC1a is Not Abundant in Axons 
Unlike the somatodendritic distribution of ASIC1a, there is controversy about its 
presence in axons. One study reported ASIC1a immunostaining in axon-like 
branches of cultured CNS neurons (77). In contrast, others failed to detect 
endogenous ASIC1a in axons (65). In addition, those studies failed to detect 
overexpressed ASIC1a in tau-positive branches of cultured neurons. Moreover, no 
detectable ASIC1a immunofluorescence was seen in axons from biolistically 
transfected slice neurons co-labeled with an axonal marker, VAMP2/synaptobrevin 
(71). Together, these data do not rule out the presence of ASIC1a in axons, but 
suggest it is probably not abundant there. The subcellular distribution of other ASIC 
subunits in brain neurons remains unclear, although ASIC2 has been suggested to 
localize to synapses in the cerebellum (78) and the retina (79).

4.3 ASIC1a Associates with Post-Synaptic Scaffolding Proteins 
Consistent with the speculation that ASIC1a functions in the postsynaptic membrane, 
ASIC1a associates with at least two synaptic scaffolding proteins, PICK1 and 
AKAP150 (Fig. 6) (80–82). Both PICK1 and AKAP150 interact with ASIC1a 
biochemically and colocalize with ASIC1a in neurons. In addition to these 
interactions, ASIC1a co-localizes with PSD-95 in dendritic spines (65, 76). This 
observation is intriguing, although there is currently no biochemical evidence for a 
direct interaction between ASIC1a and PSD-95. However, other ASIC family 
members interact with PSD-95 (83), raising the possibility of an indirect association 
between ASIC1a and PSD-95. Functionally, ASIC1a associates with several other 
synaptic signaling molecules including calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II 
(CaMKII), protein kinase A (PKA) and NMDA receptors (71, 82, 84, 85). In mice, 
disrupting ASIC1a reduced CaMKII phosphorylation, and overexpressing ASIC1a"
367,"===== Page 10 =====
670 
 
increased CaMKII phosphorylation (71). Similarly, CaMKII-dependent phosphory-
lation affected ASIC1a function; in response to NMDA receptor activation, CaMKII 
phosphorylated the intracellular C-terminus of human ASIC1a at serines 478 and 
479, which potentiated proton-elicited current and acid-induced neuron damage (84). 
Hippocampal slice recordings also suggest a functional interaction between ASIC1a 
and the NMDA receptor (Section 4.5). PKA also phosphorylates mouse ASIC1a at 
serine 478 and disrupts its interaction and co-localization with PICK1 in 
heterologous cells (85). This event is likely to be functionally important, because 
PKA binding with AKAP150 reduced ASIC1a current in heterologous cells and in 
cultured neurons (82). Together, these studies implicate ASIC1a in synaptic 
signaling networks.  
 
 
Fig. 6. Model of ASICs and interacting molecules at the synapse. ASICs are activated by 
protons, possibly from pre-synaptic release or other sources. Additional molecules can modify 
acid-evoked ASIC currents, suggesting the possibility of other ligands not yet identified (62). 
Upon activation, ASIC1a increases intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i, largely through voltage-gated 
calcium channels (VGCCs) and the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores (71). The resulting rise 
in [Ca2+]i initiates downstream signaling events, including CaMKII activation. ASIC1a 
channel activity may be regulated by interactions with CaMKII, PKA, AKAP150, calcineurin, 
PICK1 and possibly other PDZ-domain proteins (81–85). 
4.4 ASIC1a Confers Acid Sensitivity to Dendritic Spines 
The presence of ASIC1a at dendritic spines raised the question about its 
physiological effects there. To explore this question, one study tested whether 
J.A. Wemmie et al."
368,"===== Page 11 =====
Acid-Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) and pH in Synapse Physiology
671
 
 
 
ASIC1a influenced the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) at dendritic spines 
by transfecting a ratiometric Ca2+ reporter, cameleon YC3.60, into hippocampal slices 
(71). Acute acid application induced [Ca2+]i transients in wild-type spines (Fig. 7). 
Knocking down ASIC1a with siRNA attenuated the number of acid-sensitive spines. 
Conversely ASIC1a overexpression increased the number of acid-sensitive spines. 
The Ca2+ signal was also observed in the dendritic shaft and the cell body. These data 
combined with the ASIC1a localization indicate that ASIC1a confers acid sensitivity 
to dendritic spines and that ASIC1a can function as a postsynaptic proton receptor. 
 
ASIC1a homomultimeric channels conduct both Na+ and Ca2+, thus channel 
activation could increase [Ca2+]i directly, or indirectly through voltage-gated Ca2+ 
channels (VGCC) and by releasing from intracellular Ca2+ stores. In heterologous 
cells, Ca2+ influx through ASIC1a is responsible for acid-induced increase in [Ca2+]i 
(57). In contrast, in hippocampal slices, direct Ca2+ influx through ASIC1a made 
only a small contribution; most of the [Ca2+]i increase came from VGCCs and from 
intracellular stores (71). These observations illustrate the multiple mechanisms by 
which ASIC1a may influence [Ca2+]i at synapses.

of an apical dendrite from a neuron cotransfected with ASIC1a and cameleon. Two images on 
the right show the YFP/CFP fluorescence ratio (blue indicates a low ratio and red indicates a 
high ratio) obtained at baseline (pH 7.4) and during acid stimulation (pH 6). Note that pH 6 
increased Ca2+ levels in most spines. (b) Acid-induced calcium increase in spines was 
ASIC1a-dependent. ASIC1a overexpression increased while ASIC1a siRNA reduced the % of

4.5 Disrupting ASIC1a Impairs Synaptic Transmission and Plasticity 
The pH changes at the synapse, the subcellular distribution of ASIC1a, and its effects 
on dendritic [Ca2+], hinted that ASIC1a may play an important role in synaptic 
physiology and plasticity. Results from ASIC1a knockout mice support this 
possibility. An analysis of synaptic function in hippocampal slices found that long 
term potentiation (LTP) evoked by Schaffer collateral fiber stimulation, was 
impaired by the loss of ASIC1a (65). High frequency stimulation (HFS-100 Hz) 
produced potentiation in wild-type mice lasting beyond 40 minutes. However, within 
this time frame, potentiation of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSP) decayed to 
baseline in ASIC1a knockout slices. Prior to LTP induction, paired-pulse facilitation 
and single evoked EPSPs were normal, suggesting ASIC1a disruption did not impair 
presynaptic vesicle release. However, loss of ASIC1a attenuated the summation of 
EPSPs during the HFS. Interestingly, the NMDA receptor antagonist D-APV 
inhibited EPSP summation in wild-type slices but not in ASIC1a-null slices 
suggesting that the loss of ASIC1a impaired NMDA-receptor function. These data 
support the possible connection between ASIC1a and the NMDA receptor, however 
the mechanism for the suggested crosstalk remains uncertain. 
4.6 ASICs at Retinal Synapses 
Glutamate release at retinal ribbon synapses is accompanied by acidosis, raising the 
possibility that ASICs could affect neurotransmission in the retina. Recent studies 
investigated this possibility and found ASIC1a protein located in the retina near the 
synaptic cleft in bipolar cells. ASIC1a-antisense RNA and PcTx1 significantly 
decreased a- and b-electroretinogram measurements, supporting the idea that 
ASIC1a contributes to synaptic signaling in the retina (86). While ASIC1a inhibition 
decreased electroretinogram waves, knocking out ASIC2 increased the a- and b-
electroretinogram waves and caused light-induced retinal degeneration (79). Thus, 
disrupting ASIC2 produced an effect essentially opposite to that of disrupting 
ASIC1a. Further studies are needed to better understand the roles of ASIC1a and 
ASIC2 at the retinal synapse. However, the retina may be an excellent location for 
studying synaptic ASICs because of large size of retinal synapses and the proton 
release recorded there (6–8). 
4.7 Model of ASIC1a Function at the Synapse 
The available data support a model of ASIC1a at the synapse (Figs. 1 and 6). In the 
post-synaptic membrane, ASICs seem well positioned to respond to protons released 
from presynaptic neurotransmitter (NT)-containing vesicles and also from other 
sources. In this model, various extracellular modulators and intracellular ASIC-
interacting proteins might influence the response, which would be expected to 
depolarize the membrane potential and raise intracellular Ca2+ concentration, perhaps 
influencing other receptors and signaling proteins. An important prediction from this 
model is that ASIC currents will be activated during neurotransmission. However, 
thus far, studies in brain slices (65) and cultured neurons (77) have not detected

them. There are many possible explanations for these negative results, but they hint 
that the story could be more complex. Perhaps the appropriate experimental 
conditions have not been identified. Interestingly however, a recent study discovered 
spontaneous ASIC activation in HEK293 cells (87). Presumably, protons released by 
vesicles evoked the ASIC current, because blocking vesicle acidification with 
bafilomycin prevented the spontaneous currents. This finding represents a potentially 
important step in identifying how endogenous ASICs may be activated. 
4.8 ASIC1a Affects Synaptic Spine Density 
Regardless of how ASIC1a acts at the synapse, evidence for some potentially 
important consequences has been obtained. For example, it was recently found that 
knocking down ASIC1a expression with RNAi in hippocampal slice neurons 
reduced the number of dendritic spines (71). An ASIC1a dominant-negative 
construct had a similar effect. In contrast, overexpressing ASIC1a in CA1 neurons 
had the opposite effect and increased the number of dendritic spines. Possibly, the 
ability of ASIC1a to affect spine number is related to its effects on synaptic [Ca2+] 
(57, 67, 71, 84) and LTP (65), although the precise mechanisms have not yet been 
established. Nevertheless, these observations suggest ASICs may influence spine 
remodeling in disease. Unlike the effects of acutely changing ASIC1a expression, 
disrupting ASIC1a throughout development in the knockout mice did not change 
spine number, suggesting developmental mechanisms might compensate for some 
effects of ASIC1a disruption (71). Together, these functional effects on synaptic 
physiology suggest that genetically or pharmacologically altering ASIC1a might 
have important physiological and behavioral consequences. 
5 ASIC1a Regulates Behavior and May Contribute  
to Neurological disease 
5.1 Disrupting ASIC1a Impaired Cerebellum-Dependent Learning 
The location of ASIC1a in mouse brain provided important clues about the potential 
contribution of the channel to behavior. By immunohistochemistry and protein 
blotting, it was found that ASIC1a protein was enriched in gray matter and in brain 
regions with high synaptic density (65, 66, 88). One region where ASIC1a was 
abundant was the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex (Fig. 8a) (65, 66). In 
addition, Purkinje cells which populate this layer of the cerebellum have large acid-
evoked currents (75). Consistent with a role in cerebellum-dependent learning, the 
loss of ASIC1a significantly impaired classical delay eyeblink conditioning (Fig. 8b) 
(65). Mice normally learn that a tone predicts a periorbital shock and acquire the 
ability to defensively blink before the shock occurs (i.e. a conditioned response). 
After 10 days of training, wild-type mice produced conditioned responses in more 
than 80% of trials, whereas the ASIC1a-null mice produced a conditioned response 
in only 40% of trials. Disrupting ASIC1a did not alter shock sensitivity (65), hearing 
(88), or the blink reflex (65), suggesting a learning-related deficit. Although the"
371,"===== Page 14 =====
674 
 
mechanism has not been determined, the loss of ASIC1a may have impaired 
plasticity in the cerebellar cortex. 
 
 
Fig. 8  Localization of ASIC1a in brain structures underlying Pavlovian conditioning. (a) 
Immunofluorescent labeling of ASIC1a protein in ASIC1a+/+ relative to ASIC1a–/– mice 
revealed abundant ASIC1a expression in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex 
(arrowheads). (b) Consistent with a role in cerebellum-dependent learning, loss of ASIC1a 
significantly impaired delay eyeblink conditioning. When the tone and shock were not paired 
(control), neither group developed conditioned responses. (c) In the forebrain, ASIC1a 
immunolabeling was particularly abundant in the basolateral amygdala of wild-type mice 
(arrowheads). (d) Suggesting a role in amygdala-dependent learning, ASIC1a–/– disruption 
severely impaired single-shock context fear conditioning. Twenty-four hours after receiving a 
single 0.5 mA footshock, wild-type mice froze when returned to the training chamber. In 
contrast, ASIC1a-null mice froze very little. Mice not receiving a footshock during training 
(control) froze little or none during testing. Panels (a), (b), and (c) reproduced with permission 
from (65, 66, 88). 
5.2 ASIC1a Contributes to Pavlovian Fear Conditioning 
Outside of the cerebellum, ASIC1a is particularly abundant in structures that 
underlie fear behaviors including the amygdala complex, bed nucleus of the stria 
terminalis, lateral hypothalamus, habenula, cingulate cortex, and periacqueductal 
gray (56, 59, 66, 77, 88, 89). In the amygdala, multiple nuclei express ASIC1a 
including the lateral, central, and medial nuclei, although ASIC1a immuno-labeling 
was especially pronounced in the basolateral amygdala (88, 89).

The distribution of ASIC1a in fear circuit structures and the effects of ASIC1a on 
synaptic function, led to the question of whether ASIC1a influences Pavlovian fear 
conditioning. Wild-type and ASIC1a-null mice were tested in their ability to learn 
the association between a fear-producing footshock and either the environmental 
context or an audible tone (66). Disrupting ASIC1a significantly impaired both 
context fear conditioning (Fig. 8d) and tone conditioning (66). Conversely, 
overexpressing ASIC1a in the mouse brain increased fear conditioning (76). The 
effects were not due to sensory dysfunction because both hearing (88) and footshock 
sensitivity (66) were unaffected by ASIC1a gene disruption. 
5.3 Interrupting ASIC1a Reduces Unconditioned Fear 
Effects of ASIC1a on unconditioned fear responses have also been tested (67). The 
loss of ASIC1a reduced unconditioned fear in the open field test, during acoustic 
startle, and in response to predator odor. Curiously, the loss of ASIC1a did not 
reduce undonditioned fear in the elevated plus maze, suggesting that this fear 
behavior is not ASIC1a-dependent (65). The effects of ASIC1a disruption on 
unconditioned fear are probably not due to developmental abnormalities, because 
acutely inhibiting ASIC1a in the brain post-developmentally with PcTx1 venom 
reduced TMT-evoked fear in wild-type mice, but not in ASIC1a-null mice (67).  
 
The observation that ASIC1a contributes to fear learning, suggests that ASIC1a 
contributes to plasticity in the fear circuit. In addition, the finding that ASIC1a 
affects unconditioned fear suggests that ASIC1a can regulate fear circuit activity 
independent of long-lasting plasticity. These effects of ASIC1a resemble those of 
AMPA and NMDA receptors, the inhibition of which reduces both fear learning and 
the expression of learned fear. However, further studies are needed to better 
undestand how ASIC1a affects neurotransmission in the amygdala and elsewhere in 
the fear circuit. Nevertheless, the ability of ASIC1a inhibition to reduce multiple fear 
behaviors, raises the possibility that ASIC1a antagonists could reduce anxiety in 
humans and might benefit other psychiatric diseases. Anti-anxiety medications with 
novel mechanisms of action could offer advantages over current medications, which 
can cause a number of unwanted side effects. 
5.4 Ischemic Stroke 
Central acidosis exacerbates neurodegenerative diseases including ischemic stroke. 
Because Ca2+ overload causes toxicity in the ischemic brain, and because ASIC1a 
activation raises intracellular Ca2+, it was hypothesized that ASIC1a activation might 
increase ischemic cell death. Enhancement of ASIC1a function by activation of 
NMDA receptors (84), lack of oxygen or glucose (67), or accumulation of lactate or 
arachidonic acid (75) might further exacerbate ASIC1a-mediated neurotoxicity. A 
possible role for ASIC1a in ischemic toxicity was initially supported by experiments 
in cells heterologously expressing ASIC1a and in cultured hippocampal neurons 
(57). Neurons lacking ASIC1a and cells treated with amiloride or PcTx1 resisted 
acidosis-induced injury (57, 67). Moreover, PcTx1 diminished the effects of NMDA-
induced cell death (67). Establishing a strong case for a role in ischemic disease,"
373,"===== Page 16 =====
676 
 
disrupting ASIC1a in mice reduced infarct volume by 60% following experimental 
stroke due to middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (67). Interestingly, pH remains 
low for hours after a stroke, thus opening a window of therapeutic opportunity. Even 
administering PcTx1 five hours after MCA occlusion reduced infarct volume by 
>50% (90). These encouraging results endorse ASIC1a inhibitors as a potential new 
treatment for stroke. 
5.5 Central Pain Regulation 
In peripheral neurons, ASICs contribute to acid-evoked nociception (reviewed in 
(62)). Recently, ASICs in the central nervous system (CNS) were also implicated in 
pain control (91). Inhibiting ASIC1a in the CNS by injecting PcTx1 or ASIC1a anti-
sense RNA into the cerebrospinal fluid reduced inflammatory and neuropathic pain. 
The analgesic effects were linked to elevated met-enkephalin levels. The possible 
relationship between ASIC1a function at the synapse and met-enkephalin expression 
is not yet clear, although it is interesting to speculate that blocking ASIC1a could 
attenuate previously observed anti-opiod effects of FMRFamide related peptides 
(92). Thexse observations suggest a promising opportunity for targeting ASICs in 
pain control. 
6 Concluding Remarks 
The identification of ASIC1a as synaptic proton receptors and an increasing 
appreciation of pH dynamics in the CNS suggest new possibilities for proton 
mediated cellular signaling. Although much remains to be learned about the ASICs, 
the available data indicate an intriguing role in synapse function. Perhaps like a 
neurotransmitter, protons cross the synapse to activate or modulate ASICs and other 
proteins. In addition, at the cell surface and at synapses, ASICs may be readily 
accessible to pharmacological modification, suggesting fertile ground for novel drug 
discovery. Studies in mice point to possible therapeutic benefits of ASIC1a 
antagonists in psychiatric disease, neurodegeneration, and pain.

1 Introduction 
Long before the discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP), Ramon y Cajal recog-
nized glia’s intimate association with synapses in the brain. Though their function 
was at that time a mystery, he predicted that glia must be doing more than simply 
filling the spaces between neurons. Not surprisingly, Cajal was correct. Although 
incapable of firing action potentials, glia are highly excitable cells, communicating 
with neurons and other glia primarily through chemical signals. While it is well 
established that glia have many important support functions in the nervous system, 
emerging evidence reveals a far more dynamic role for glial cells at the synapse.  
 
We now appreciate that glia express many of the same voltage-gated ion channels 
and neurotransmitter receptors that neurons do and are thus well equipped to receive 
and transmit neuroactive signals. Through these mechanisms, glia can signal to pre 
and postsynaptic neurons and affect synaptic excitability and plasticity. Glia also 
actively communicate with one another in the form of calcium waves. The realiza-
tion that dynamic bi-directional signaling between neurons and glia modulates syn-
aptic transmission has led to re-definition of the synapse. The “tripartite synapse” is 
a term that was recently coined to incorporate glia as the third participant at the syn-
apse, actively communicating with both the pre- and the post-synaptic neuron (2) 
(Fig. 1c).  
 
Glia also play an important role in the development and maintenance of synapses. 
Their appearance at synapses in the postnatal brain and developing neuromuscular 
junction coincides with periods of developmental plasticity. A growing body of 
research indicates a pivotal role for glial-derived signals in the formation of struc-
tural and functional synapses. In addition, glia appear to secrete multiple signals that 
control the remodeling and stabilization of synapses, as well as the modulation of 
synaptic plasticity.

It is becoming increasingly clear that glia can no longer be regarded as passive 
bystanders at the synapse. Neuroscientists are now appreciating that glial cells not 
only support essential neuronal functions, but also actively communicate with both 
neurons and one another to influence synaptic structure and function. This chapter 
reviews recent evidence for the role of glia in synapse development and synaptic 
transmission and plasticity."

2 Types of Glial Cells Associated with Synapses 
In the human brain, glial cells outnumber neurons by a factor of ten, and numerous 
glial subtypes are easily identified based on their unique morphological, physiologi-
cal, and biochemical features. Major types of glia in the nervous system include: 
myelinating glia (oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells), astrocytes, and microglia. In 
the CNS, glia that communicate with synapses include astrocytes, oligodendrocyte 
progenitor cells and possibly microglia. In the PNS, perisynaptic Schwann cells 
(PSCs) ensheath synapses at the neuromuscular junction. 
 
Classical neurohistologists divided astrocytes into two main classes, which are 
distinguished by morphology and location, and perhaps function as well. Protoplas-
mic astrocytes are found in grey matter and their processes are closely associated 
with synapses as well as blood vessels. Fibrillary (or fibrous) astrocytes in white 
matter contact nodes of Ranvier. In addition, there are specialized astrocytes includ-
ing Müller glia in the retina and Bergmann glia in the cerebellum. 
 
 Although most roles of protoplasmic astrocytes remain a great mystery, there is 
little doubt that they buffer ions and neurotransmitters in the extracellular space. 
Astrocytic processes intimately contact and ensheath pre- and postsynaptic terminals 
(115). Until recently, our understanding of astrocyte morphology was based on clas-
sical immunostaining for a widely used astrocytic marker GFAP, (glial fibrillary 
acidic protein), which grossly underestimates the complexity of astrocytes and their 
interactions with neurons and other cells (Fig. 1b). Recent in vivo imaging and three 
dimensional reconstructions of dye filled astrocytes revealed that adjacent astrocytes 
extend thousands of dense spongiform processes and are organized into large, non-
overlapping anatomical domains. In fact, it has been estimated that a single astrocyte 
can associate with an average of four neurons (40), and contact over 100,000 syn-
apses (14) (Fig. 1). Astrocytes express receptors for most neurotransmitters, and can 
release a variety of neuroactive, synaptogenic and trophic factors. Together these 
findings place astrocytes in an important position to actively exchange signals with 
neurons and other glial cells to coordinate synaptic networks. 
 
Recent research has revealed a surprising new role for oligodendrocyte precursor 
cells (OPCs) at the synapse. These cells represent a third class of glia in the adult 
CNS and have morphological and physiological features distinct from oligodendro-
cytes and astrocytes (19, 49). These small, stellate shaped glial cells express the 
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, NG2. Based on their anatomical and physiological 
properties, it is likely that many of the cells originally classified as “complex cells” 
or “immature astrocytes” are actually NG2+ OPCs (NG2 cells). While the function 
of this new class of glial cells is still unknown, recent electrophysiological and ana-
tomical studies revealed that NG2 cells express an array of voltage gated channels, 
as well as receptors for neurotransmitters. However unlike ensheathing perisynaptic 
glia, which respond to “spillover” of chemical transmitters from presynaptic termi-
nals, NG2 cells receive direct synaptic inputs from neurons (81). These findings 
challenge current dogma that functional synapses are a unique feature of neurons. 
 
Microglia comprise about 10% of CNS glia, and exist in multiple morphological 
states in the healthy and damaged brain. Like other glial cell types, much of their 
function remains mysterious. They act as internal “sensors” of the extracellular"

environment, rapidly responding to and communicating changes in the levels of 
extracellular ions and signaling molecules to neurons and glia. Recent in vivo time-
lapse imaging has revealed dynamic interactions between microglia and neurons in 
the brain following lesion or injury (23, 73). Much like immune cells, microglia can 
elicit inflammatory responses and phagocytose cellular debris in response to injury, 
but new research indicates that microglia may also play a role in synapse develop-
ment in the healthy brain. 
3 Role of Glia in Synapse Formation and Development 
The traditional assumption that the ability of neurons to form synapses is intrinsic led 
early studies on synaptic development to focus on neuronal signals and surface 
molecules. However, in the last decade, mounting evidence from a variety of studies 
has demonstrated a role for glia in the formation of both the central and peripheral 
nervous system synapses. In this section we will discuss these studies and their influ-
ence on our current perception of glia as an active partner in the development of the 
nervous system. 
3.1 Role of Astrocytes in Synapse Formation in the Central Nervous 
System 
Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the brain. Through their intricate proc-
esses, astrocytes ensheath synapses and are known to listen and respond to synaptic 
signals. Do they also play a role in the establishment of the synaptic contacts in the 
developing brain? Interestingly, there is a strong correlation between the timing of 
the birth and maturation of astrocytes and the formation of synapses in the CNS. For 
example, in the visual system, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) reach their thalamic 
targets in the superior colliculus beginning around embryonic day 16 and most RGC 
axons innervate the colliculus by the day of birth, postnatal day 0 (54). Despite the 
arrival of axons in their target area, there is a one week delay before the majority of 
synapses are formed in the superior colliculus. Coincident with this delay, the birth 
and proliferation of astrocytes in the superior colliculus also occurs during the first 
postnatal week. This spatiotemporal correlation between synaptogenesis and astro-
cyte development strongly suggests that signals from astrocytes might regulate the 
initiation of synapse formation (114). The presence of this additional regulatory step 
in the timing of synaptogenesis might be necessary to ensure that all axons reach 
their targets before the competition for synaptic territory begins.  
 
Do astrocytes regulate the formation of synapses? Evidence supporting the hy-
pothesis that astrocytes secrete extracellular signals that induce synapse formation 
has emerged from in vi tr o studies with purified RGCs. RGCs can be purified from 
 
In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), perisynaptic Schwann cells are special-
ized non-myelinating Schwann cells that ensheath the synaptic junction between 
motor neuron and muscle fibers PSCs are important for the formation, function and 
maintenance of neuromuscular junctions and play a pivotal role in synaptic repair 
after injury."

rodent retina and can be cultured in defined serum-free media with the support of 
several neurotrophic factors in the absence other cell types. Under these conditions, 
RGCs have equally high rates of survival and neurite outgrowth, regardless of 
whether or not they are cultured in the presence of astrocytes (62). Using these cells 
Pfrieger and Barres found that RGCs cultured in the absence of astrocytes exhibited 
very little spontaneous synaptic activity when excitatory postsynaptic currents were 
measured by patch-clamp. In contrast, the RGCs exhibited high levels of synaptic 
activity when they were cultured in the presence of a feeding layer of astrocytes or 
astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) (86) (Fig. 2). They have concluded that the 
 
 
 
Fig. 2. Astrocytes promote synapse formation via the release of secreted factors. 
(a) RGCs require astrocyte-secreted factors to form synapses. Immunostaining of RGCs for 
colocalization of presynaptic Synaptotagmin (red) and postsynaptic PSD-95 (green) shows 
few co-localized synaptic puncta in the absence of astrocytes indicating that RGCs alone did 
not form many synapses. Many synapses (colocalized puncta) were present in RGCs cultured 
with a feeding layer of astrocytes or with purified TSP. (b) Astrocytes induce synapse forma-
tion in two steps. First TSP and/or other synaptogenic factors induce formation of structural 
synapses that have pre and post synaptic specializations and presynaptically active but post-
synaptically silent as no significant action potentials can be recorded. A second factor(s) acti-
vates these postsynaptically silent synapses by facilitating insertion of AMPARs to the postsy-
naptic site."

The TSP-induced synapses are ultrastructurally normal with pre- and postsynap-
tic specializations similar to those in RGC cultures grown with an astrocyte feeding 
layer. TSP treatment did not affect the total levels of synaptic proteins but instead 
induced synapse formation by promoting the localization of synaptic proteins to 
synapses and the alignment of pre and postsynaptic sites (20). Interestingly, while 
the TSP-induced synapses are structurally normal and presynaptically active, they 
are postsynaptically silent, due to the lack of surface AMPA receptors at postsynap-
tic sites (20). In contrast, astrocyte feeding layers and ACM can each induce both 
pre- and postsynaptic activity (Fig. 2). These data suggest that the regulation of syn-
aptogenesis by astrocytes occurs in at least two steps (112). Astrocytes provide TSPs 
 
 
 
 
 
ability of astrocytes to enhance synaptic activity depends on astrocyte-secreted pro-
teins. This activity was mimicked by Schwann cells, and oligodendrocytes, but not 
by fibroblasts or microglia (86, 112). Similar to RGCs, purified spinal motor neurons 
exhibited little synaptic activity unless astrocytes or Schwann cells were present 
(113). Taken together, these findings reveal that astrocytes and other perisynaptic 
glia, such as Schwann cells, release soluble signals that profoundly enhance synaptic 
activity by nearly 100-fold. 
 
To determine whether this increase in synaptic activity could be attributed to an 
increase in either synapse number or synaptic efficacy, Ullian and colleagues exam-
ined the effects of astrocytes on the number of synapses that formed between RGCs 
in vitro. They found that astrocytes induce a 7-fold increase in synapse number be-
tween RGCs, as measured by immunostaining with pre- and postsynaptic markers, as 
well as by electron microscopy (114). These synapses were ultrastructurally normal 
and they were both pre- and postsynaptically functional. Patch-clamp recordings 
from neurons that have been grown at clonal density and allowed to synapse upon 
themselves (a.k.a. autaptic neurons), showed a close correlation between the number 
of synapses observed by immunostaining and the number of synapses estimated by 
measuring the quantal content of the evoked response. Taken together, these findings 
show that astrocytes profoundly increase the number of synapses that form between 
CNS neurons in vitro. This was the first evidence that the number of synapses a 
neuron can form is not solely determined by the intrinsic properties of that neuron 
but instead can be powerfully controlled by extracellular signals. The 7-fold increase 
in synapse number, however, is not as large as the nearly 100-fold increase in synap-
tic activity induced by astrocytes suggesting that astrocytes can also enhance synap-
tic function. 
 
What are the astrocyte-secreted factors that induce synapse formation? Interest-
ingly, Christopherson and colleagues identified Thrombospondins (TSP) as the sig-
nals coming from astrocytes that can induce an increase in synapse number (20). 
They showed that purified TSP1 can increase synapse number in RGC cultures to a 
similar degree to ACM (Fig. 2). TSPs are a family of very large (450kDa) oligomeric 
extracellular matrix proteins and they are normally expressed in brain by glia and are 
present in ACM. TSP2, a closely related TSP family member, was also found to 
induce synapse formation at levels similar to TSP1, and was the major TSP type in 
the ACM. Immunodepletion of TSPs from ACM decreased its synaptogenic effect 
down to control levels showing that TSPs are the key synaptogenic component of 
ACM (20)."

and/or other synaptogenic molecules to drive the assembly of synapses that have pre- 
and postsynaptic specializations but lack postsynaptic AMPA receptors thus are 
postsynaptically silent (Fig. 2B, middle panel). Astrocytes also secrete a second 
signal that converts these silent synapses into functional units (Fig. 2B, right panel). 
This silent to active synapse conversion through the activation of AMPA receptor-
mediated responses resembles the AMPA receptor-dependent enhancement of synap-
tic strength observed following the induction of long-term potentiation (32) suggest-
ing that astrocytes also secrete signals that play important roles in synaptic plasticity.  
 
How do TSPs promote synapse formation? Most likely TSPs provide a permis-
sive signal for synapse formation within the developing brain. However, if TSPs are 
permissive and are required for synapse maintenance, they should also be present in 
the adult CNS where synapses are stably maintained. Infact there are five TSP iso-
forms in mammals and recent developmental gene expression analysis of astrocytes 
in rodent brain revealed an interesting spatial and temporal expression pattern for 
TSPs (25). All TSP isoforms except TSP5 are expressed by astrocytes. In agreement 
with previous observations, TSP1 and 2 are expressed by young astrocytes in devel-
oping brain during the first two postnatal weeks, when the bulk of synaptogenesis 
takes place. As the animal matures their expression goes down. In contrast, TSP4 
expression is only detected in mature astrocytes (after postnatal day 17). These re-
sults suggest that TSP4 is the adult form of TSP in the CNS and might play a role in 
synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the adult brain.  
 
Recent data indicate that all TSP isoforms are synaptogenic, but that they differ 
in their effects on neurite outgrowth. TSP1 promotes RGC neurite extension, while 
TSP4 inhibits outgrowth and branching in vitro (25). This differential effect on neu-
rite outgrowth might explain the reason for this developmental isoform switch. Early 
in development neurons are required to both extend their neurites and form new 
synapses. Correspondingly TSP1 and TSP2, which promote both of these processes, 
are expressed. As the animal matures, the major neural circuits are established and 
the formation of new synapses does not require extensive outgrowth; thus synapse 
formation and maintenance function is taken over by TSP4 in the adult brain. Sur-
prising recent work comparing gene expression patterns in brains of humans and 
other nonhuman primates reveals that in humans TSP4 and TSP2 expression levels 
are dramatically increased (15). Does this mean that humans, because of TSPs, have 
a greater capacity to form synapses, and that this capability underlies our increased 
brain function?  
 
Is TSP the only synaptogenic signal secreted by astrocytes or just the tip of the 
iceberg? Further study of astrocyte-secreted proteins and their role in synapse  
 
Do TSPs promote synapse formation in vivo? Interestingly, TSP1 and TSP2 are 
expressed in the brain during the early postnatal stages when the majority of syn-
apses are forming, and both proteins are significantly down-regulated in the adult 
when rate of synaptogenesis is significantly reduced (20). In agreement with the in 
vitro data, TSP1/TSP2 double mutant mice exhibited a 25–30% reduction in the 
number of synapses formed during first and third postnatal weeks (20). In conclu-
sion, TSPs are the key synaptogenic signal in ACM, TSP1 and TSP2 expression 
coincides with synaptogenesis in vivo, and loss of TSP1/2 function significantly 
decreases synapse formation."

formation is necessary to answer this question. Astrocytes might secrete other signals 
that are capable of inducing formation of structural synapses similar to TSPs or they 
may also secrete signals that inhibit synapse formation. Secretion of both positive 
and negative regulators of synapse formation would give astrocytes the ability to 
regulate the timing and location of synapse formation with greater precision. Addi-
tionally, while identification of TSP significantly improved our understanding of the 
role of astrocytes in synapse formation, discovery and characterization of the neu-
ronal TSP receptor will help clarify the cellular mechanism by which TSP estab-
lishes synaptic contact and might help us to better understand molecular basis of 
synapse formation in the CNS.  
 
In addition to astrocyte-secreted proteins, Mauch et al. identified cholesterol in 
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) particles coming from astrocytes as a potential signal that 
induces the formation of functional synapses between RGCs in culture (58). They 
observed that cholesterol enhances synaptic activity by increasing the quantal con-
tent of evoked responses in autoptic RGCs. This increase can be explained by an 
increase in the number of release sites (36). In addition, cholesterol is a limiting 
factor in synaptic vesicle formation and is required for vesicle turn-over events due 
to its regulation of vesicle curvature (109). Cholesterol is also necessary for lipid raft 
formation, and its membrane concentration can be critical for correct function of 
signaling processes as well as the activity of postsynaptic glutamate receptors that 
regulate synaptic function (43). One caveat is that most of these experiments were 
performed on autaptic neurons cultured at clonal density and thus these neurons were 
possibly in highly cholesterol-starved condition. Thus, future studies are necessary to 
determine the importance of astrocyte-derived cholesterol for synaptogenesis in vivo. 
Interestingly, in higher density cultures, cholesterol enhanced presynaptic function 
while it had no effect on postsynaptic function, and its effects in increasing synapse 
number were negligible (20). 
 
Astrocytes also regulate the formation of inhibitory synapses between hippocam-
pal neurons in vitro (24). When hippocampal neurons were either co-cultured with 
astrocytes or treated with astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM), Elmariah et al. 
observed a significant increase in the number of inhibitory pre- and postsynaptic 
terminals, as well as an increase in the frequency of miniature IPSCs . They further 
explored whether the neurotrophin, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and 
its receptor Tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB), which are potent modulators of in-
hibitory synaptic structure and function, mediate the effects of astrocytes on inhibi-
tory synapses. Astrocytes deficient in either BDNF or TrkB maintained the ability to 
increase the number of inhibitory pre- and postsynaptic specializations in wild type 
neurons. However when neurons from these knockout mice were treated with wild 
type ACM, no increase was observed in the number of postsynaptic GABA (A) 
receptor clusters even though the increase in the number of inhibitory presynaptic 
terminals persisted. These results suggest that astrocytes may modulate inhibitory 
postsynaptic development by stimulating Trk signaling between neurons, but that the 
neurons themselves are the source of TrkB ligand BDNF. It is noteworthy that astro-
cytes modulate inhibitory synapse formation via distinct pre- and postsynaptic 
mechanisms, quite similar to the two step model of astrocytes regulation of excita-
tory synaptogenesis."

In addition to their role in development, astrocytes might also modulate synapse 
formation in the adult CNS. Two consequent studies by Song et al. on neuronal stem 
cells elegantly show that astrocytes indeed play an active role in synaptogenesis in 
adult brain. Stem cells from the adult hippocampus require a signal to differentiate 
into neurons. One source of this signal is hippocampal astrocytes (102). Once the 
stem cells have differentiated into their appropriate neuronal cell types, however, the 
neurons need an additional signal from astrocytes in order to integrate into synaptic 
circuits (102, 103). The second astrocyte signal appears to be necessary to promote 
an increase in synapse number in fully differentiated neurons. This work suggests 
that astrocytes continue to play a role in synaptogenesis in the adult brain and are 
involved in integration of newly born neurons into already existing circuits in the 
hippocampus. Whether TSPs or other known astrocyte derived signals are involved 
in this process remains to be discovered. 
 
Besides astrocyte-secreted factors that induce synapse formation, astrocytes 
might also regulate synapse formation through contact mediated mechanisms. A 
study by Hama et al. provided evidence that astrocytes affect neuronal synaptogene-
sis by the process of adhesion (41). They showed that local contact with astrocytes 
via integrin receptors activates protein kinase C (PKC) in individual dissociated 
neurons. They observed that PKC activation, while initially focal, eventually spread 
throughout the entire neuron and facilitated excitatory synaptogenesis. Thus, they 
conclude that propagation of PKC signaling represents an underlying mechanism for 
global neuronal maturation following local astrocyte adhesion (41). One interesting 
difference between this clonal density hippocampal neuron culture system and RGCs 
is that treatment with ACM alone is able to induce RGC synapse formation, while 
hippocampal neurons require astrocytic contact. One possible reason for this discrep-
ancy could be the age difference between the hippocampal neurons (isolated from 
embryonic day 17 brains) and RGCs (isolated from postnatal day 5 retinas). There 
might be an age dependent switch in neurons in which their ability to respond to 
soluble synaptogenic signals from astrocytes is induced by another environmental 
cue, such as contact with astrocytes themselves. Indeed, Ullian et al., found that 
astrocyte contact induced embryonic (E17) RGCs to become receptive to synapto-
genic signals secreted from astrocytes (E. Ullian and B. Barres, in preparation). 
3.2 Role of Perisynaptic Schwann Cells in Synapse Formation in the PNS 
Parallel to astrocytes’ role in CNS synapse formation, Schwann cells (SCs), the 
perisynaptic glia at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), also actively participate in 
PNS synaptogenesis and synaptic function.  
 
The classical doctrine of NMJ formation states that motor neuron derived factors 
such as Agrin induce the clustering of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) 
(60). Is there also a SC component to NMJ formation? Indeed early studies on the 
formation of NMJ pointed to the presence of a factor that was able to induce upregu-
lation of postsynaptic AChR subunits. This factor was then cloned and identified as 
Neuregulin, also known as AChR inducing activity (ARIA). Interestingly, 
Neuregulins are growth/differentiation factors essential for SC lineage differentiation 
and survival. In addition to their effects on SCs, Neuregulins have been associated"

C. Eroglu et al. 
 
with NMJ formation. A decade ago Trachtenberg and Thompson (111) found that the 
addition of the Neuregulin to developing NMJs resulted in SC process extension and 
migration away from the synapse. Coinciding with SC migration, the nerve terminals 
retracted from the synapse and regrew along with the SCs away from postsynaptic 
sites. The motor neuron (MN) axons were unable to make synapses onto muscle until 
the Neuregulin was removed. They suggested that SCs directly instruct the synaptic 
remodeling that occurs in vivo and they concluded that SCs play an important role in 
the formation of the NMJ synapse. However, it is been hard to pinpoint the cellular 
origin of Neuregulin function as both SCs and MNs express the receptors for 
Neuregulin. It was suggested that either Neuregulin independently induces both the 
SCs and MN axons to leave the synapse and reenter a plastic growth state, or 
Neuregulin affects only SCs by inducing them to become synaptogenic. 
 
Recently Cao and Ko characterized SC-CM’s effect on synaptic function (16). 
They found that SC-CM increased the frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents 
 
If SCs regulate synaptogenesis at the NMJ then lack of SCs should affect NMJ 
formation and function. A conditional knockdown of Neuregulin1 in motor and sen-
sory neurons led to the total loss of Schwann cells in the peripheral nerves. However 
there were no significant changes in the AChR gene expression (120). On the other 
hand mice deficient in ErbB2, a Neuregulin receptor, also failed to develop the 
Schwann cell lineage, a defect that was accompanied by impaired development of 
the junctional folds of NMJ synapses (52). Similarly, an elegant study by Reddy and 
colleagues showed that when perisynaptic Schwann cells were ablated by comple-
ment lysis in live frog muscles, formation of synapses was dramatically reduced and 
existing synapses underwent retraction (90).  
 
SCs strongly induce the formation of functional synapses between spinal MNs 
(113) or between Xenopus MNs and muscle cells in culture (82). SC-conditioned 
medium (SC-CM) mimics these effects, indicating the presence of soluble SC-
secreted factors that promote synapse formation in PNS. How do SCs increase syn-
apse number in MN-muscle co-cultures? Peng and colleagues proposed that SCs 
promote synaptogenesis by instructing neurons to synthesize a factor necessary for 
NMJ formation and showed that SC-CM induced an increase in Agrin expression by 
cultured MNs. This way SCs may mediate a switch in MNs from a growth state to a 
synaptogenic state (82). This is quite reminiscent of the permissive role of TSPs in 
the CNS. It is possible to postulate that glia act as switches both in PNS and CNS, 
converting axons from growth state to synaptogenic state. Feng and Ko identified 
transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) as a component of SC-CM that is able to 
induce formation of synapses in Xenopus nerve-muscle cultures (26). They showed 
that TGF-β1 protein was present in SC-CM and that treatment of nerve-muscle cul-
tures with purified TGF-β1, in the presence of trophic stimulation, induced neuronal 
Agrin expression and synaptogenesis along nerve-muscle contacts. Immunodepletion 
of TGF-β1 with a specific antibody abolished the synaptogenic effect of SC-CM. 
Latency-associated protein (LAP), which binds to TGF-β1 and prevents it from bind-
ing to TGF-β1 receptors, also blocked the effect of SC-CM (26). Taken together, 
these results indicate that TGF-β1 in SC-CM may be the glial signal that instructs 
neurons to switch from a “growth state” to a “synaptogenic state”."

150-fold at developing neuromuscular synapses. This was a presynaptic effect inde-
pendent of neuronal excitability and required the influx of Ca2+, most likely through 
L and N-type voltage gated calcium channels potentiating spontaneous transmitter 
release. In contrast, SC-CM suppressed the evoked transmitter release. The molecu-
lar weight of functional factor(s) in SC-CM was within 500 and 5000 Da range and 
the SC-CM effect was not attributable to currently known factors that modulate 
synaptic efficacy, such as neurotrophins, glutamate, or ATP (16). These results sug-
gest that SCs release small molecules that enhance spontaneous synaptic activity 
acutely and potently at developing neuromuscular synapses; however it is not yet 
clear whether this small factor also contributes to the increase in synapse number 
observed by Ullian et al. and Peng et al. Taken together, these studies show that SCs, 
like astrocytes, secrete synapse-promoting factors that can increase the number of 
MN synapses in vitro and profoundly affect NMJ formation and function.
 
3.3 Role of Glia in Synapse Elimination and Refinement of Neural 
Circuits 
During development, the formation of mature neural circuits requires the selective 
elimination or pruning of inappropriate synaptic connections. The specific molecular 
mechanisms that drive synapse elimination remain a mystery but it is has been hy-
pothesized that synapses are removed by either the retraction of presynaptic axons or 
the degeneration of axons and their subsequent phagocytosis by glial cells. Recent 
evidence suggests that glia may not only be engulfing axonal debris, but may also be 
actively involved in the process of developmental pruning.  
 
In the Drosophila nervous system, larval mushroom body (MB) γ neurons ini-
tially extend axon branches into the dorsal and medial MB axon lobes that later un-
dergo fragmentation and pruning. Awasaki and colleagues recently used a combina-
tion of high resolution imaging and molecular approaches to label MB axons to show 
that glial cells are recruited to MB axon lobes before axonal fragmentation and that 
they engulf MB axonal varicosities prior to their degeneration. Importantly, glial 
invasion and axon pruning was significantly impaired when the ability of glia to 
phagocytose was perturbed by inhibitors of glial endocytosis (5). In addition, Watts 
et al. showed that MB γ neuron terminals were incorporated within the lysosomal 
compartments of neighboring glial cells, further suggesting a role for phagocytosis in 
axon pruning (119). It was later shown that glial cells recognize and engulf degener-
ating MB axons through the function of Draper, the glial engulfment receptor (6, 33). 
Together these findings strongly suggest that glia actively contribute to developmen-
tal pruning in Drosophila.  
 
A similar process of axon removal by SCs, termed “axosome shedding”, occurs 
during synapse elimination at the mammalian NMJ junction. Postsynaptic muscle 
cells are initially innervated by multiple motor axons, but by the second postnatal 
week, a process of activity-dependent competition promotes the permanent elimina-
tion of the majority of these immature inputs, allowing only one input to be main-
tained and strengthened (95). As the losing axon withdraws, its distal ends form a 
retraction bulb (34, 92). Until recently, it was not known how these retraction bulbs 
formed or how retracted axons were eliminated. A combination of time-lapse"

Moreover, a recent study has provided evidence that the classical complement 
cascade, part of the innate immune system, helps to mediate synapse elimination in 
the developing CNS. In the developing mammalian visual system, astrocytes induce 
neuronal expression of C1q, the initiating protein of this cascade. C1q’s best known 
role in the innate immune system is to opsonize or “tag” unwanted cells or debris for 
elimination. Recent work shows that C1q is expressed by postnatal retinal ganglion 
neurons in response to immature astrocytes and is then localized to synapses 
throughout the postnatal brain and retina (105).  Mice deficient in complement pro-
tein C1q or the downstream complement cascade protein C3 exhibit large sustained 
defects in CNS synapse elimination, as shown by the failure of anatomical refine-
ment of retinogeniculate connections and the retention of excess retinal innervation 
by lateral geniculate neurons. Microglia, the resident phagocytes of the brain, ex-
press receptors for C1q and C3, and have been shown to phagoctose synaptic termi-
nals of motor neurons following injury, in a process known as synaptic stripping. 
Together these findings add to the growing evidence that immune system molecules 
are crucial for patterning of neural circuits (11, 45), and support a model in which 
unwanted synapses are tagged by complement proteins for elimination by phagocytic 
cells.  As C1q levels become highly elevated in the adult brain in the setting of neu-
rodegenerative disease, these findings also raise the interesting possibility that the 
classical complement cascade mediates synapse loss in diseases such as Alzheimer’s 
disease, ALS, and glaucoma. 
3.4 Role of Glia in Synaptic Maintenance and Structural Plasticity 
3.4.1 Glia in Synaptic Maintenance  
Glia have traditionally been viewed as the support cells that provide trophic support 
to neurons and maintain the homeostatic environment necessary for proper synaptic 
function. Are glia also necessary for the maintenance of the synaptic adhesions? To 
find out, Ullian and colleagues (114) examined whether the glial-induced synapses 
would be maintained in culture if the glial cells were removed. First synapses were 
allowed to form by co-culturing purified RGCs with a feeder layer of astrocytes 
cultured on a removable insert. After 1 week, as expected many synapses had 
formed. They then removed the astrocyte insert and cultured RGCs alone for an 
additional week. When they examined the synapses formed by these RGC neurons  
 
 
 
imaging and serial electron microscopy (EM) demonstrated that as inappropriate 
axons disappeared, they shed small membrane bound particles termed “axosomes” 
that contain intact synaptic vesicles and organelles. Importantly, axosomes were 
formed by the engulfment of the tips of retreating axons by neighboring SCs (10). It 
was suggested that this phagocytic process is a novel means of transferring synaptic  
information between the cytoplasmic compartments of neurons and glial cells. While 
it is not known what molecules drive this phagocytic process, this study raises the 
intriguing possibility that glia actively contribute to synapse elimination in  
mammals."

by immunostaining and patch clamp recording, they found that the majority of syn-
apses were lost when the astrocytes were removed (114). These findings provide 
evidence that astrocytes are required for synapse stability, ensuring synaptic mainte-
nance. This also raises the possibility that astrocytes may increase synapse number 
by enhancing synapse stability. However, dissection of synapse maintenance from 
other possible mechanisms such as enhancement of the rate of formation of synapses 
by astrocytes is difficult. The relative contribution of astrocytes to synapse formation 
and stabilization need to be investigated further. 
 
Are perisynaptic Schwann cells also required for synaptic maintenance and func-
tion? Reddy et al. showed that in addition to their role in the establishment of the 
NMJ, SCs play a very important role in the maintenance of synaptic adhesion and 
synaptic function in mature NMJ (90). Using the frog NMJ as a model system, they 
investigated the effects of removing synaptic glia from a mature synaptic contact. 
Perisynaptic SCs in an intact adult frog were selectively labeled with a monoclonal 
antibody that specifically recognizes these cells. Once the antibody labeled cells 
were exposed to complement and lysed via the complement cascade, the presynaptic 
MN terminals and the postsynaptic muscle cell were intact but “naked”, lacking their 
synaptic partner the perisynaptic SC. Interestingly, one week post ablation the pre-
synaptic function at the naked synapses decreased by half and there was a ten-fold 
increase in the retraction of presynaptic terminals from the muscle. Taken together 
these studies suggest that SCs in PNS and astrocytes in CNS play important roles in 
stabilizing mature synaptic contacts. 
So far we have reviewed the function of glia in the formation and maintenance of 
synapses as well as the elimination of unwanted ones. Capability of astrocytes and 
Schwann cells to control the establishment and breakdown of synapses gives them 
the ability to sculpt our nervous system, begging the question of whether glial signals 
also regulate structural plasticity in the brain. 
 
Dendritic spines are small protrusions visible on dendrites of neurons that serve 
as postsynaptic sites for excitatory inputs. They are highly dynamic structures and a 
large body of research has linked changes in spine number and morphology to 
changes in neuronal activity and experience (53). During development spines are 
highly dynamic whereas in the adult brain they become more stable; hence a correla-
tion exists between age dependent spine dynamics and the plasticity of the brain. The 
decrease in spine motility in adult could also be attributed to the close association of 
astrocytes with synapses. Astrocytes might provide both physical constraints that 
inhibit spine movement as well as molecular interactions that stabilize spines. Indeed 
an exciting study by Murai et al. showed that astrocytes help to control dendritic 
spine morphology in vivo through bi-directional Ephrin/EphA signaling (68). They 
observed that in the hippocampus, astrocytes and their processes express Ephrin A3, 
while neurons express the Ephrin receptor EphA4. Interestingly, soluble Ephrin A3 
was sufficient to cause spine retraction in hippocampal slice cultures and transfecting 
neurons with a kinase inactive EphA4 resulted in longer spine extension. Together, 
these experiments imply that this receptor-ligand interaction regulates spine shape by

inhibiting spine extension. An ephA4 knockout mouse showed extension of spines in 
hippocampal slice cultures similar to dominant negative EphA4 transfected neurons, 
indicating that this receptor is required to maintain spine morphology (68). This 
work suggests that, in addition to soluble factors released by astrocytes, there might 
be bi-directional, contact-mediated, signaling between astrocytes and neurons that is 
important for maintenance of synaptic structure and number. Recently, timelapse 
imaging in mature hippocampal slices has shown that astrocyte processes and their 
neigbouring spines move cooperatively, further signifying a direct link between these 
two structures (39). In addition, a similar study using two-photon time-lapse imaging 
of astrocytic and dendritic processes revealed that dendritic protrusions with astro-
cytic contacts had longer lifetime and were morphological more mature (75). They 
showed that both motility of astrocytic processes and the Ephrin/EphA4 signaling 
between spines and astrocytes were necessary for astrocyte-dependent stabilization 
of newly generated dendritic protrusions. They proposed a model in which astrocytic 
processes are key local regulators of both the stabilization of individual dendritic 
protrusions and their subsequent maturation into spines. 
 
A classical study supporting an active role for glia in developmental synaptic 
plasticity investigated the role of astrocytes in ocular dominance plasticity in the 
primary visual cortex (66). During visual system development in animals with bin-
ocular vision such as cats or humans, inputs corresponding to each eye converge and 
establish permanent connections in segregated columns in the visual cortex. This 
division of cortex into ocular dominance columns is an activity-dependent event, 
requiring active inputs from both eyes. If the input from one eye is prevented by 
either lid suture (monocular deprivation) or tetrodotoxin injection, the columns from 
the open eye expand extensively into the territory of the closed eye. This plasticity of 
synaptic inputs, termed ocular dominance plasticity, occurs only during the first 4–7 
weeks after birth in cat visual cortex. In addition, if the deprived eye is reopened 
anytime after 7 weeks after birth, the deprived eye can no longer regain its lost terri-
tory; in contrast, if the eye is reopened before the end of this critical period, it can. 
These events are known to depend on neuronal activity, NMDA receptors, and in-
hibitory input (42). 
 
Several lines of evidence suggest that astrocytes may also play a role in ocular 
dominance plasticity. First, there is a temporal correlation between the critical win-
dow for ocular dominance plasticity and the immature state of astrocytes in the cor-
tex. In addition, dark rearing that is known to prolong ocular dominance plasticity 
also prolongs astrocyte immaturity, as assessed by delay of expression of GFAP, a 
marker of older astrocytes (65). Amazingly, when Muller and Best injected immature 
astrocytes from newborn kitten into the visual cortex of adult cats after the termina-
tion of the critical period, ocular dominance plasticity period was reopened (66). The 
implication of these results is that astrocytes play two roles in ocular dominance 
plasticity: immature astrocytes are instructive for synaptic plasticity, while mature 
astrocytes may help limit synaptic plasticity. 
 
Could maturation of astrocytes be a general signal for the end of critical period 
plasticity in the CNS? A study by Pizzorusso et al. suggests that chondroitan sulfate 
proteoglycan (CSPG), an extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule that is secreted by 
mature astrocytes, might be involved in the regulation of plasticity in the mature"

visual cortex (88). They found that the appearance of CSPGs in the visual cortex is 
temporally correlated with the end of the critical period and that, like astrocyte matu-
ration, their appearance can be delayed by dark rearing. Could immature astrocytes 
breakdown the limiting CSPG matrix thus reopen critical period plasticity? Indeed 
when Pizzorusso et al. dissolved the CSPG network in the brain enzymatically, the 
critical period was reopened, mimicking the effect of immature astrocyte transplanta-
tion observed by Muller and Best. This work implies that astrocytes can use secreted 
molecules to signal the end of the critical period and alter synaptic plasticity. Are 
there other molecules involved in astrocyte-regulation of synaptic plasticity? And 
what are the changes that astrocytes go through as they mature? Answering these 
questions will surely broaden our understanding of CNS development. 
 
There is also evidence that myelination may help signal the end of critical period 
plasticity in the brain (30). Myelin proteins, such as Nogo, myelin associated glyco-
protein (MAG) and oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp), are strong inhibi-
tors of axon outgrowth and regeneration after injury. In part, they have been found to 
inhibit axon growth through their interaction with the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR), 
which is expressed by neurons. Interestingly, the period of ocular dominance plastic-
ity is dramatically prolonged in mice deficient in NgR (59). These findings suggest 
that physiological NgR signaling is involved in ending the critical period, however 
they fall short of demonstrating a role for myelin-associated NgR ligands as there is 
emerging evidence that these ligands are also localized to developing synapses. 
 
In addition to their role in developmental plasticity, astrocytes have also been 
linked to regulation of synaptic plasticity of the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus in 
the adult. Activation of this system by release of oxytocin due to physiological con-
ditions such as parturition or lactation leads to a fast coordinated withdrawal of as-
trocytic processes that normally lie between neuronal cell bodies and innervating 
dendrites and the somatodendritic synapses (4
a significant increase in the number of GABAergic, glutamatergic, and noradrenergic 
synapses as postsynaptic target sites, which were previously shielded by astrocytes, 
become available (107). In addition since the astrocytes have withdrawn from synap-
tic sites, glutamate concentration at the synapse increases, leading to a dramatic 
increase in neuronal excitability (87). It is possible that astrocyte-secreted ECM 
molecules that regulate cell adhesion such as PSA-NCAM and Tenascin-C are in-
volved in these structural changes at the synapse (108). These studies also suggest 
that astrocytes, most likely through their blood vessel-associated end-feet, can detect 
and respond to somatic stimuli that may be critical for the initiation of important 
structural and functional plasticity in the adult CNS.  
2). After astrocyte withdrawal there is 
 
In conclusion, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes can regulate developmental struc-
tural plasticity of the CNS through modulation of dendritic spine dynamics, ECM 
and myelination. Whether the inability of the CNS to regenerate after injury is actu-
ally a side effect of the glial regulation of plasticity remains an intriguing and impor-
tant question."

4. Role of Glia in Synaptic Transmission in the Mature Nervous 
System 
4.1 Activity-Dependent Neuron-Glia Communication at the Synapse 
There is little question that glia perform several regulatory roles essential for normal 
neurotransmission and that there are many mechanisms by which glia indirectly 
regulate synaptic function. Astrocytic processes surround pre- and postsynaptic ter-
minals where they rapidly clear and recycle ions and neurotransmitters from the 
synaptic cleft. Astrocytes express high levels of glutamate transporters, GLAST 
(glutamate/aspartate transporter) and GLT1 (glutamate transporter1), which actively 
clear the synapse of excess transmitter. During neurotransmission, glutamate is taken 
up by astrocytes, converted into glutamine, and then released into the extracellular 
space. Glutamine uptake by neurons is subsequently used to synthesize glutamate 
and GABA, the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Importantly, astrocytes 
also protect neurons from excessive glutamate and other forms of excitotoxicity by 
both regulating pH and buffering potassium and other ions released during neuro-
transmission.  
 
It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that glia also play a more direct role 
in modulating synaptic transmission. The notion that glial cells are active, excitable 
cells emerged with the advent of new techniques with which to study glia. The first 
clue that the close structural relationship between glia and synapses played an impor-
tant role in modulating synaptic transmission came from the realization that peri-
synaptic glia, like their neuronal partners, express membrane receptors for most 
neurotransmitters (43). Although incapable of firing action potentials, glia can re-
spond to neuronal activity via the activation of metabotropic neurotransmitter recep-
tors. When activated, these neurotransmitter receptors promote the production of 
second messengers and the release of calcium from intracellular stores. Glial calcium 
signaling is thus a measurable indicator of cell excitability, providing a powerful tool 
to study the activity of glial cells in action.  
 
Do glia signal back to synapses? Activity-dependent activation of glial receptors 
can induce the synthesis and release of several neuroactive substances, including 
ATP (and its byproduct, adenosine), glutamate, and D-serine. Activity-dependent 
release of “gliotransmitters” affects synaptic activity in neurons and modulate synap-
tic efficacy and plasticity. Time-lapse calcium imaging has demonstrated that glia 
surrounding synapses respond to neuronal activity with increases in intracellular 
calcium and that activity-dependent communication between glia and neurons is bi-
directional. Chemical or mechanical stimulation of glia can in turn elicit calcium 
responses in nearby neurons. Glia also actively communicate with each other 
through intercellular calcium waves. Stimulation of a single astrocyte can trigger a 
local elevation in astrocytic calcium that can subsequently spread to neighboring 
astrocytes in the form of a calcium wave. This section highlights examples of activ-
ity-dependent intercellular communication between neurons and glial cells in the 
CNS and PNS (Fig. 3)."

Schematic illustrating several forms of neuron-glia communication at the synapse. The “tripar-
tite synapse” in the CNS (Box) is composed of presynaptic neuron, postsynaptic neurons, and 
the processes of protoplasmic astrocyte, which ensheath synaptic terminals. Neuron-glia 
communication is bi-directional and include neuron to glia signaling (1) and glia to neuron 
signaling (2). Neurons form direct synaptic contacts onto NG2 cells in the brain (3). Astrocytic 
calcium waves (shaded) propagate between neighboring astrocytes is a well studied example 
of glia-glia communication. Several of the key signals and mechanisms mediating each form 
(1–4) of synaptic communication are highlighted. *note: adenosine is generated from the rapid 
degradation of ATP by ectonucleotidases. 
4.2 Neuron to Glia Communication 
Are glia actively listening to neurons at synapses? Activity-dependent neuron-glia 
communication has been extensively studied at NMJ. Elegant electrophysiogical and 
imaging studies performed at the intact frog and mouse NMJ have demonstrated that 
perisynaptic SCs (PSCs) respond to high frequency stimulation of motor nerves with 
increases in intracellular calcium (91, 94). Nerve-evoked calcium responses in PSCs 
are mediated the by the activation of purinergic and muscarinic receptors following 
the release of ATP and acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal (94). In addition, 
classic neuromodulators such as neuropeptides and nitric oxide (NO) can fine-tune 
neurotransmitter-evoked calcium signaling in PSCs just as they do in neurons. One 
of the functional consequences of the synaptic activation of transmitter receptors in 
PSCs may be the activation of downstream intracellular signaling pathways and"

subsequent regulation of glial gene expression. As we’ll discuss later, activation of 
PSCs by synaptic activity also leads to the regulated release of gliotransmitters that 
can act presynaptically to modulate synaptic transmission and short term synaptic 
plasticity. 
 
The retina has proven to be a valuable model system in which to study activity-
dependent neuron glia communication in intact CNS tissue. Müller cells, specialized 
radial glia that expand almost the entire depth of the retina, actively communicate 
with both astrocytes and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Müller glia express mem-
brane receptors for ATP and other transmitters and are responsive to mechanical, 
chemical and electrical stimulation. Importantly, natural stimulation of RGCs by 
repetitive flashes of light elicited rapid calcium transients in Müller cells that were 
blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX)(69). This activity-dependent response in Müller glia 
was shown to be mediated by presynaptic release of ATP by neurons (69).  
 
It appears that synaptic control of glial excitation is widespread in the brain. 
Electrophysiological studies using acute brain slices have revealed active communi-
cation between neurons and astrocytes following stimulation of neurons and their 
subsequent release of transmitters (28, 116). A classic study by Porter and McCarthy 
(1996) demonstrated for the first time that astrocytes in acute brain slices respond to 
glutamate released directly from nerve terminals in an activity-dependent manner 
(89). Subsequent studies from a number of laboratories have shown that glial cal-
cium increases are mediated by the synaptic release of transmitters that act on a 
variety of astrocytic receptors including muscarinic receptors (1) and GABA recep-
tors (47). Importantly, activity-dependent neuron-glial synaptic signaling also occurs 
in vivo under physiological conditions.  A recent study by Wang et al. provided 
compelling evidence that astrocytes respond to sensory input in vivo. Two photon 
imaging in anesthetized mice showed that whisker stimulation evoked increases in 
astrocyte calcium levels within layer 2 of barrel cortex of adult mice (117). Sensory-
evoked increases in astrocytic calcium were frequency-dependent and were mediated 
in part by ectopic glutamate release, which is in agreement with previous ex-vivo 
studies.  
 
Bergmann glia, the specialized astrocytes of the cerebellum, are exquisitely sensi-
tive to synaptic activity. Stimulation of cerebellar granule cells in acute slices in-
duced rapid calcium transients in associated Bergmann glia (48). Similarly, electrical 
stimulation of parallel fibers elicited calcium signaling in Bergmann glia that was 
mediated by nitric oxide release (37, 57). Interestingly, Bergmann glia have hun-
dreds of subcellular compartments termed ‘microdomains’ that wrap around syn-
apses and respond with increases in intracellular calcium following electrical stimu-
lation (37). Bergmann glia, like neurons, are sensitive to the pattern and frequency of 
neuronal activity. Single pulse stimulation of parallel fibers evoked local calcium 
fluxes in microdomains, whereas multiple trains of pulses evoked much larger and 
sustained calcium increases in Bergman glia cell bodies and processes. Frequency-
dependent neuron-glia signaling has also been demonstrated in hippocampal slices 
(80) and at the NMJ (46, 91, 93). That glia are sensitive to the pattern of neuronal 
firing suggests that glia are capable of sensing and integrating information from 
neurons according to functional requirements of neural circuits."

4.2.1 Synapses Between Neurons and Glia  
Glial cells have recently challenged the dogma that fast synaptic transmission occurs 
exclusively between neurons. Direct activity-dependent neuron-glia communication 
was recently demonstrated between NG2- positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells 
(NG2 cells) and neurons. These small stellate-shaped cells are the newest subtype of 
CNS glia and they have attracted significant attention due to their widespread distribu-
tion in the brain and their persistence in the developing and mature nervous system.  
 
In contrast to perisynaptic astrocytes and Schwann cells, which ensheath syn-
apses and respond to the ectopic release of chemical transmitters, electrophysiologi-
cal and anatomical evidence indicates that NG2 cells form direct synaptic junctions 
with both glutamatergic and GABAeric neurons. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings 
of NG2 cells in acute hippocampal slices revealed that NG2 cells responded to affer-
ent stimulation with the extremely rapid kinetics traditionally associated with neu-
ron-neuron synaptic communication. In addition to activating calcium signaling in 
NG2 cells, quantal release of neurotransmitter from neurons triggered rapid activa-
tion of AMPA receptors and evoked postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in NG2 cells 
(8). These findings suggested that fusion of synaptic vesicles in neurons induced the 
binding of glutamate to AMPA receptors on NG2 cells. Indeed, single NG2 cells 
processes were often located in direct contact with synaptic junctions (8). Although it 
is possible that ionotropic receptors on NG2 cells were activated by ectopic release 
of transmitter, electron microscopy analysis revealed that nerve terminals containing 
synaptic vesicles formed synaptic junctions with the processes of NG2 cells. NG2 
cells also express ionotropic GABA (A) receptors and direct GABAergic signaling 
between neurons and NG2 cells has also been observed (50). 
 
Direct rapid synaptic communication between NG2 cells and neurons is not lim-
ited to the hippocampus. NG2 cells are found in both grey and white matter through-
out the developing and adult CNS (19, 49). In the molecular layer of the adult cere-
bellum, climbing fibers from the inferior olive form direct synaptic connections with 
NG2 cells, in addition to Purkinje cells. In fact, it has been estimated that NG2 cells 
can receive up to 70 inputs from a single climbing fiber. In addition, unlike Purkinje 
neurons, NG2 cells are often innervated by multiple climbing fibers, which suggests 
a major role for NG2 cells in cerebellar circuitry. Indeed, activation of climbing fiber 
inputs resulted in excitatory AMPA synaptic currents in NG2 cells (51). Given their 
widespread distribution, it is likely that direct signaling between NG2 cells and neu-
rons is a general phenomenon. What is the functional significance of this rapid neu-
ron-glia signaling? This remains an important and open question. It may enable neu-
rons to rapidly regulate gene expression in NG2 cells according to functional 
requirements. Neurons could also rapidly signal NG2 cells to release gliotransmitters 
and signal back to pre- and postsynaptic neurons, as has been described for astro-
cytes and perisynaptic Schwann cells.

plexity to synaptic signaling in the CNS. Neurotransmitters released by presynaptic"

neurons not only evoke local calcium oscillations in nearby glial cells, but can also 
trigger calcium waves through glial networks, which might allow for the transmis-
sion of synaptic signals over extensive cortical areas. 
 
In culture, stimulation of a single astrocyte can trigger a local elevation of astro-
cytic calcium that can subsequently spread to neighboring astrocytes in the form of a 
calcium wave. Calcium waves can propagate at a rate of 100 μm/sec (18) and over a 
distance of hundreds of micrometers (96, 28). Intracellular and intercellular calcium 
waves involve the activation of G-coupled receptors, activation of phospholipase C, 
and the production of the second messenger IP3, which triggers calcium release from 
intracellular ER stores. Although these waves can occur spontaneously, the fre-
quency and extent of calcium signaling can also be potentiated by mechanical, elec-
trical and chemical stimulation. 
 
What mechanisms underlie the propagation of calcium waves? Waves can be 
transmitted to neighboring astrocytes via either the local diffusion of second messen-
gers through gap junction channels or the release of “gliotransmitters” such as ATP 
along astrocytic networks. Recent evidence suggests that these two mechanisms are 
likely to work together to coordinate signaling between glial cells. Gap junction 
mediated propagation of calcium waves was the first such mechanism described in 
astrocytes (31), and there is now convincing evidence from a number of groups that 
disruption of gap junction channels impairs the propagation of calcium waves in 
vitro and in vivo (83, 96). In addition, extracellular ATP released from stimulated 
astrocytes has been shown to propagate long-range calcium signaling via the activa-
tion purinergic receptors (P2Y) on neighboring astrocytes (38). There is also evi-
dence for a “point source ATP release” mechanism in which calcium waves are 
propagated via the release and diffusion of ATP from the stimulated cell and the 
activation of purinergic receptors on neighboring astrocytes (4). The mechanism of 
ATP release from astrocytes is still not clear. Possible mechanisms include calcium-
dependent exocytosis and ATP release through connexin hemichannels (116). 
 
An important question is whether propagating calcium waves through glia nor-
mally occur in vivo. Currently there is little evidence that intercellular astrocytic 
calicium waves occur under conditions considered to be physiological. Spontaneous 
and evoked calcium waves occur between Müller glia and astrocytes in the intact 
retina and other systems (28, 71), but there are clear differences in the extent and 
magnitude of waves in different tissue preparations, which has led to confusion in 
the field. Curiously, electrical stimulation generally fail to elicit large propagating 
astrocytic waves in most brain slice preparations (37, 48, 89) or in vivo (44, 74). 
Instead, calcium increases are typically observed in a few neighboring astrocytes in 
response to local stimulation. This, together with the realization that astrocytes are 
organized into distinct non-overlapping domains, suggests the existence of local 
astrocytic circuits (14, 106).  
 
Are calcium waves physiological or pathological? It is clear that intercellular 
waves can be induced in culture and in situ under more pathological conditions. 
Propagating waves have been observed in corpus collosum glia (99) and rat cortical 
slices (85) in association with spreading depression associated with ischemia and 
injury. Schipke and colleagues demonstrated that ATP and activity- induced astro-
cytic calcium waves can propagate over hundreds of micrometers in situ and can"

trigger responses in microglial cells (99). Recent advances in high resolution imaging 
and molecular approaches to study neuron-glia communication in anesthetized and 
awake behaving animals will hopefully shed light on these important issues (73, 74). 
 
An important function of rapid intercellular communication among groups of 
astrocytes could be to modulate and coordinate the activity of neural circuits. Retinal 
ganglion cells actively respond to waves of calcium that ripple through neighboring 
Müller glia (72) in situ. Increases in neuronal spontaneous and evoked activity occur 
in response to calcium waves in neuron-astrocyte co-cultures (3) and in intact tissue 
slices (28). Astrocytic calcium signaling also have important consequences for the 
cerebral vasculature. In addition to ensheathing thousands of synapses, astrocytic end 
feet are also in direct contact with blood vessels. Recent time-lapse imaging experi-
ments provide convincing evidence that calcium increases in astrocytic endfeet can 
regulate blood flow in associated blood vessels (67, 122). In the retina, stimulation of 
glia in the intact retina can evoke dilation or constriction of arterioles (61). Although 
the mechanisms underlying astrocyte-vessel signaling are still unclear, these recent 
findings point toward a possible role for astrocytes in controlling vasculature func-
tion and possibly dysfunction in pathophysiological conditions and disease. 
4.4 Glia-Neuronal Signaling at the Synapse 
Glia rapidly respond to synaptic activity, but can glia signal back to the synaptic 
terminal to influence synaptic function? This question has been investigated exten-
sively over the past decade in several model systems and more recently in vivo. It is 
now well established that activated glia can release neuroactive molecules including 
ATP (21, 70, 118), glutamate (77), inflammatory cytokines (9), vasoactive molecules 
(123) and D-Serine (64) that could signal back to pre- and postsynaptic terminals to 
modulate synaptic activity and function. 
 
Perhaps the best example of glial modulation of synaptic transmission in vivo 
occurs at the mammalian NMJ. Perisynaptic SCs at the mammalian and amphibian 
NMJs respond to the release of Acetylcholine and ATP from the presynaptic termi-
nal with robust increases in intracellular calcium (91, 46). It is well established that 
repetitive stimulation of motor neurons induces synaptic depression by decreasing 
presynaptic transmitter release. Recent research implicates the perisynaptic Schwann 
cell (PSC) as a major player in this form of synaptic depression. Activation of PSCs 
induced release of a chemical signal from PSCs that stimulated nitric oxide produc-
tion at the NMJ. This glial induced NO release mediates synaptic depression by 
decreasing the probability of presynaptic acetylcholine release (110). 
 
What is the functional consequence of this activity-dependent neuron-glia com-
munication? Perisynaptic Schwann cells can both positively and negatively influence 
synaptic transmission, depending on the types of glial signaling pathways activated 
during synaptic transmission. Sustained IP3- dependent calcium influxes in peri-
synaptic Schwann cells can regulate synaptic strength (17); conversely, synaptic 
activation of G-protein coupled signaling cascades in Schwann cells can affect synaptic 
depression as described above. Together these findings suggest that activity-dependent 
activation of specific signaling cascades in terminal Schwann cells can integrate synap-
tic activity and directly influence neuronal activity and synaptic efficacy."

The first evidence that astrocytes can directly modulate the activity of adjacent 
neurons came from studies using neuron-glial co-cultures. Araque and colleagues 
found that elevations in intracellular calcium in astrocytes (by electrical or mechani-
cal stimulation) resulted in a corresponding slow inward current in hippocampal 
neurons. They went on to show that calcium-dependent release of glutamate from 
astrocytes enhanced the frequency of postsynaptic currents in neurons by acting on 
extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (3, 77). Glutamate was later shown to mediate astro-
cyte-neuron signaling in acute brain slices. Fiacco and McCarthy (27) recorded from 
CA1 pyramidal cells in acute brain slices while evoking Ca2+ increases in the adja-
cent stratum radiatum astrocytes. They used whole-cell patch clamping to deliver 
caged IP3 and a Ca2+ indicator dye to astrocytes. Uncaging IP3 in astrocytes pro-
duced a propagating calcium wave that spread into fine distal astrocytic processes 
that perfectly coincided with a significant increase in the frequency of AMPA spon-
taneous excitatory post synaptic currents (sEPSCs) in CA1 neurons. Recent evidence 
also suggests that astrocytes may be a necessary mediator in activity-dependent 
modulation of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus. Stimulation of interneurons 
elicited a GABA(B)-receptor-mediated elevation of calcium in surrounding astro-
cytes, which in turn potentiated inhibitory transmission (47).  
 
ATP is a key signal mediating the propagation of astrocytic calcium waves, rais-
ing the question of whether astrocytic ATP release might regulate synaptic transmis-
sion. In the retina, electrical activity of retinal ganglion neurons (RGCs) is depressed 
in response to glial calcium waves that propagate through the retinal ganglion cell 
layer (72). It turned out that Müller glia inhibited RGC firing via the release of ATP, 
which was converted to adenosine by ectotidonucleases and activated adenosine 
receptors on RGCs (70). A very similar process has been recently demonstrated in 
acute hippocampal slices. Glial-derived adenosine acts on presynaptic A1 receptors 
in neurons leading to inhibition of calcium channels, a decreased probability of ve-
sicular release and reduced frequency of sEPSCs (79). Glial mediated synaptic de-
pression has also been demonstrated in cerebellar slices in the case of depression of 
Purkinje neurons by Bergmann glia (12). Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated 
that ATP release from glia can also positively regulate synaptic transmission. ATP 
activation of postsynaptic ionotropic P2X receptors increases postsynaptic intracellu-
lar calcium levels, which is thought to regulate insertion of AMPA receptors, thereby 
increasing excitatory synaptic transmission (35). 
 
It has been proposed that astrocytes may normally release vesicle-stored gluta-
mate in vivo at synapse like contacts onto neurons, but recent studies suggest that this 
is unlikely. Regulated glutamate release by astrocytes has been measured in culture 
and several mechanisms of release have been proposed including: calcium-dependent 
exocytosis, volume-sensitive ion channels, gap junction hemichannels, and the large 
pore of the ionotropic P2X7 ATP receptor (78). There is little evidence, however, 
that glutamate can normally accumulate in astrocytes in vivo. To directly address the 
question of whether stimulation of calcium waves in astrocytes induces them to 
secrete signals that are sufficient to activate nearby neurons, Fiacco et al., (2007) 
constructed transgenic mice that express a Gq-coupled receptor specifically in astro-
cytes (29). This enabled them to use an agonist that would activate calcium waves 
specifically in astrocytes. Despite widespread calcium elevations in astrocytes,"

nearby neuronal activation could not be detected. These new findings call into ques-
tion the popular notion that calcium-dependent release of glutamate or other glio-
transmitters by astrocytes directly affects neuronal synaptic activity in vivo.  
5. Role of Glia in Synaptic Plasticity 
As we discussed in the previous section, glia have the ability signal to neurons 
through neuromodulators and neurotransmitters that affect pre- and/or postsynaptic 
function. This signaling between glia and synapses establishes glia as a major player 
in the regulation of the functional plasticity at the synapse. Indeed, recent literature 
shows that several factors secreted by glia play an active role in activity-dependent 
modulation of synaptic efficacy, a process that is known to contribute to neural cir-
cuit development and experience-dependent plasticity. 
 
The most well known forms of synaptic plasticity are long-term potentiation 
(LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which involve rapid adjustments in the 
strength of individual synapses in response to specific patterns of correlated synaptic 
activity. The postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors, AMPA receptors 
(AMPAR) and NMDA receptors (NMDAR), are thought to be central players in 
these plasticity processes through the regulation of their surface delivery, retention 
and calcium channel properties (22, 100). NMDARs contain a glutamate binding site 
as well as a site for glycine, a coagonist that is required for the opening of the cal-
cium channel. In the past decade an unlikely amino acid D-serine emerged as a po-
tent agonist for this site. Interestingly, D-serine is exclusively produced by the glial 
enzyme serine racemase, which converts L-serine to D-serine (63). D-serine is se-
creted by astrocytes through a vesicular release process that is dependent on 
AMPAR activation in glial cells. This indicates that the glutamate, which is released 
onto perisynaptic astrocyte processes by neurons during synaptic transmission, could 
be a signal that induces D-serine secretion by astrocytes (97, 98).  
 
Interestingly, neuronal activity-dependent release of D-serine might be necessary 
for hippocampal LTP (121). When Yang and colleagues cultured hippocampal neu-
rons in contact with astrocytes, the neurons were capable of undergoing LTP; how-
ever neurons grown in ACM without direct astrocytic contact were not. The addition 
of exogenous D-serine restored the ability of neurons grown in ACM to undergo 
LTP. These data suggest that astrocytes are actively involved in synaptic plasticity 
by regulating the availability of D-serine, released at perisynaptic astrocyte proc-
esses. Recently Panatier and colleagues looked at the function of D-serine mediated 
NMDAR signaling in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (76), a system in which 
structural changes in astrocyte association with synapses are known to be important 
for the oxytocin-mediated responses at synapses. They provided compelling evi-
dence that in this hypothalamic structure the endogenous co-agonist of NMDA re-
ceptors is D-serine rather than glycine. Therefore, the degree of astrocytic coverage 
of neurons governs the level of glycine site occupancy on the NMDA receptor, 
thereby affecting their availability for activation and thus the activity dependence of 
LTP/LTD (76). In conclusion, D-serine released by astrocytes is a major regulator of 
NMDA function thus a potent regulator of synaptic plasticity."

In addition to regulation of NMDAR function, surface delivery of AMPARs is 
thought to be an important mechanism in the regulation of LTP and LTD. Beattie et 
al. showed that the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha released by glia enhanced 
synaptic efficacy by increasing surface expression of AMPA receptors (7). Blocking 
TNF-alpha signaling had opposite effects. The authors suggested that the continuous 
presence of TNF-alpha is crucial for the preservation of synaptic strength at excita-
tory synapses. Interestingly, even though TNF-alpha increased surface AMPAR 
expression, LTP and LTD were not affected in its absence (104). 
 
Homeostatic synaptic scaling, a second form of synaptic plasticity, involves uni-
form adjustments in the strength of all synapses on a cell in response to prolonged 
changes in the cell's synaptic activity such as blockade of synaptic function. This 
regulation might be critical for preventing neural networks from becoming unstable 
and dysfunctional (13). The mechanisms responsible for synaptic scaling have gen-
erally remained a mystery, with the exception of evidence that regulation of receptor 
content at synapses might be involved (84). Stellwagen and Malenka showed that 
TNF-alpha mediates synaptic scaling in response to prolonged activity blockade 
(104). Using mixtures of wild-type and TNF-alpha-deficient neurons and glia, they 
were able to illustrate that glia are the source of the TNF-alpha involved in this synap-
tic scaling. Since TNF alpha is secreted by microglia in response to injury, TNF-alpha 
mediated synaptic plasticity might modulate neural responses to injury and neurode-
generation such as Alzheimer disease. Further studies will be necessary to address 
whether such TNF-alpha signaling is present in vivo under normal developmental 
conditions or whether it is an injury mediated adaptation mechanism. Characterization 
of the underlying molecular mechanisms through which TNF-alpha can induce 
AMPAR surface expression will also improve our understanding of this phenomenon.  
 
Another synaptic plasticity mechanism that requires coordinated regulation of 
synaptic function is heterosynaptic depression. This phenomenon was first noticed in 
the retina and was later shown to be mediated by the ability of an active synaptic 
pathway to laterally regulate the relative strength of neighboring synapses (55). Such 
a mechanism is also present in hippocampus and it entails the specific depression of 
an unstimulated pathway in the presence of another independent pathway in which 
LTP is induced (56). This inter-synaptic communication is regulated by adenosine 
through A1 receptors (56). Recently, vesicular release by astrocytes was reported to 
be crucial for heterosynaptic depression (79). To do so they created a transgenic 
mouse line in which a dominant negative SNARE domain that is known to inhibit 
vesicular exocytosis was specifically expressed in astrocytes using a GFAP pro-
moter. Heterosynaptic depression was prevented in these mice despite the fact that 
LTP could still be potentiated. They also showed that this effect was mediated by 
secreted ATP, which is converted to adenosine and accumulates at the synapse to 
mediate its inhibitory function through A1 receptors. These results provide evidence 
that ATP released by astrocytes is required for heterosynaptic depression. An impor-
tant caveat is that the conclusion that the vesicular ATP derives from astrocytes 
depends on the absolute specificity of dominant negative SNARE expression in 
astrocytes. This specificity might be difficult to achieve with the GFAP promoter, as 
GFAP is expressed in some neural stem cells, which could thus give rise to neurons 
that also express the dominant negative SNARE construct."

Glia as Active Participants in the Development and Function of Synapses
707
 
 
 
 
To investigate the trigger of glial ATP release, Serrano and colleagues tested 
whether Ca2+ activation of glial cells was necessary for heterosynaptic depression 
(101). Indeed, a rise of intracellular Ca2+ in glial cells, induced by activation of glial 
GABA (B) receptors, was required for heterosynaptic depression. This effect could 
be inhibited by blocking ATP degradation, indicating that ATP-adenosine signaling 
was downstream of Ca2+ signaling in glia (101). Taken together these results indicate 
that GABA released by inhibitory neurons activates Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes, 
which leads to secretion of ATP. This ATP is then converted to adenosine in the 
extracellular space, where it activates A1 receptors on the post-synaptic excitatory 
neuron, inducing synaptic depression. The presence of this regulatory network 
modulating heterosynaptic depression is an elegant example of how neuron-glia/glia-
neuron interactions mediate complex plasticity processes in the brain.  
In conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence that glia use their ability to respond to 
neurotransmitters and secrete neuromodulators to actively regulate a number of 
processes involving synaptic plasticity. 
6. Concluding Remarks 
It is becoming increasingly clear that glia play a crucial and dynamic role at the 
synapse and influence functions that have long been thought to be strictly under 
neuronal control. The inclusion of glial cells as active participants at the synapse is 
gradually shifting long-standing neurocentric perspectives on how the brain works. 
Glial signals help promote both the formation and elimination of synapses as the 
brain wires up during development. Once the appropriate synaptic connections are 
formed, glial cells then influence their maintenance and stabilization in the mature 
CNS and PNS. We now appreciate that glia are well equipped to actively communi-
cate with pre and postsynaptic neurons at the tripartite synapse. This dynamic two-
way dialogue can directly influence synaptic transmission and several well studied 
mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, including LTP and synaptic scaling. Over the past 
decade, an exciting new field has emerged, and neuroscientists are gradually begin-
ning to appreciate a more “gliocentric” view of the synapse (Fig. 4).  
 
The recent work reviewed here lays a strong foundation for understanding the 
many roles that glia play in synapse development and function, and paves the way 
for many future studies. Several important and open questions remain including:  Do 
astrocytes (and other glia) control the location and timing of critical period plastic-
ity? What are NG2+ progenitor cells doing in the adult brain and what is the function 
of their direct synaptic contacts with neurons? Why are astrocytes organized into 
non-overlapping anatomical domains? Could glia actively influence neural circuits to 
control information processing? Do glia release gliotransmitters and directly control 
synaptic function in vivo? As glia are crucial for the normal structure and function of 
synapses, it has been difficult to dissect out their normal role in synapse function and 
behavior in vivo. Recent advances in the power of live imaging has allowed us to 
observe glia in action, but there is still a need for better molecular tools to study and 
manipulate specific types of glial cells at the right place and time in vivo. Regardless, 
the exciting new findings highlighted here lay a strong foundation in new area of 
neuroscience, in which there is much to explore and re-explore."

ity. With respect to short term plasticity, the mossy fiber synapse with CA3 pyramids 
is notable among CNS synapses for its dramatic paired pulse facilitation (~ 3 fold), 
as well as, its striking frequency facilitation in which the synaptic gain can exceed 20 
fold (37). By contrast, mossy fiber synapses formed with interneurons exhibit vari-
able short term plasticity ranging from depression to modest facilitation (37). 
Equally dramatic differences between these synapses have been identified with re-
spect to long term plasticities. Like many cortical synapses, high frequency stimulation 
of the mossy fibers induces LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse (Fig. 2). By 
contrast, this same high frequency stimulation of the mossy fibers induces LTD of 
the mossy fiber-interneuron synapse (Fig. 2). Thus it seems that invasion of the same 
high frequency train of action potentials into a giant bouton triggers LTP of the giant 
bouton’s synapse with a CA3 pyramidal cell but LTD of the bouton’s filopodial 
extension with an interneuron. Notably, whereas induction of LTD at most CNS 
synapses requires sustained application of low frequency stimulation of the afferents, 
induction of LTD of the mossy fiber-interneuron synapses is produced by the same 
HFS stimulus of the mossy fibers that produces LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 pyra-
mid synapse (29)."

The mechanisms underlying the plasticity of the mossy fiber synapses with CA3 
pyramids contrast sharply with mechanisms of plasticity of the Schaffer collateral 
synapse with CA1 pyramids and most other cortical synapses. Whereas induction of 
LTP of the Schaffer collateral synapse with a CA1 pyramid requires NMDA recep-
tors, induction of LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse is not dependent 
upon NMDA receptors. Moreover, whereas expression of NMDA receptor-
dependent LTP is mediated by insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic 
membrane of the CA1 pyramids (31), the expression of NMDA receptor-independent 
LTP at the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse is mediated by increased release of 
glutamate from the mossy fiber terminals (37).   
At least two distinct mechanisms underlie LTD of the mossy fiber synapses with 
interneurons in stratum lucidum. Common to each mechanism of LTD is the re-
quirement for elevation of calcium postsynaptically (27). At synapses containing 
calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, expression of LTD resides presynaptically, 
mediated by a reduction of glutamate release. At synapses containing calcium-
impermeable AMPA receptors, expression is mediated by removal of AMPA recep-
tors from the postsynaptic membrane as occurs in LTD of Schaffer collateral syn-
apses with CA1 pyramidal cells (27).  
The striking divergence of HFS-induced plasticity at distinct terminals of the 
mossy fiber axons implies remarkable compartmentalization of the molecular signal-
ing events underlying these plasticities. Whereas LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 pyra-
mid synapse requires cAMP dependent signaling cascades, neither form of LTD of 
the mossy fiber synapses with interneurons involves cAMP signaling. 
5.6 Plasticity of Mossy Fiber Synapses in Animal Models of Epileptogenesis 
The fact that high frequency stimulation of the mossy fibers in vitro produces these 
plasticities of mossy fiber synapses suggests that recruitment of the dentate granule 
cells into high frequency firing during limbic seizures in vivo may induce similar 
plasiticities of mossy fiber synapses. That is, field potential recordings reveal that the 
dentate granule cells fire synchronously at high frequency during a seizure in vivo 
(25), a firing pattern predicted to result in LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid 
synapse as well as LTD of the mossy fiber-interneuron synapses.   
Analyses of mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapses in hippocampal slices isolated 
several weeks after chemoconvulsant (kainic acid) induced status epilepticus provide 
evidence that the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse had indeed undergone LTP in 
vivo (16). The amplitude of mossy fiber evoked fEPSPs in CA3 was greater in slices 
from animals following status epilepticus compared to controls, evidence that the 
synapse had undergone LTP in the epileptic animals. High frequency stimulation of 
the mossy fibers induced LTP in slices from control animals, but not from animals 
following status epilepticus, implying that LTP had been occluded and further sup-
porting the idea that the synapse had already been potentiated in the status epilepti-
cus treated animals. Likewise, paired pulse facilitation and frequency facilitation 
were impaired in slices following status epilepticus compared to control, further 
implying that the synapse had undergone potentiation in vivo during status epilepti-
cus. Finally, biochemical studies revealed increased release of glutamate in mossy"

In contrast to the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse, studies of the mossy fiber-
interneuron synapses in slices isolated from an animal model of limbic epilepsy have 
not been reported. Interestingly, interneurons in stratum lucidum are among the 
most, if not the most, sensitive CNS neurons to death induced by either status epilep-
ticus or global ischemia (30, 5). Thus these neurons may have been absent from the 
hippocampal slices isolated from kainic acid treated animals in which LTP of the 
mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse was identified (16). This subpopulation of stra-
tum lucidum interneurons possesses a very high density of dendritic spines and ex-
presses both the calcium binding protein, calretinin, as well as somatostatin (5). 
Together with other types of interneurons within stratum lucidum, this subpopulation 
is thought to provide feedforward inhibition to the CA3 pyramidal cells.  
The induction of LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse, if combined 
with death of stratum lucidum interneurons and the presumed loss of feedforward 
inhibition, would be expected to facilitate functional connectivity of granule cells 
with CA3 pyramidal cells and compromise the dentate gate. Such effects on this 
local circuit could contribute to a lowered threshold for triggering seizure activity in 
CA3 pyramids with subsequent propagation through limbic circuitry and may con-
tribute to emergence of spontaneous recurrent seizures in the kainic acid model. 
5.7 TrkB and Plasticity of Mossy Fiber Synapses 
fiber synaptosomes prepared from the epileptic compared to control animals. To-
gether with in vitro studies of the effects of high frequency stimulation of mossy 
fibers, it seems likely that the high frequency firing of the granule cells and their 
mossy fiber axons during status epilepticus induced LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 
pyramid synapse.  
The question arises as to whether signaling through TrkB might contribute to LTP of 
the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse during limbic epileptogenesis. As noted 
above, evidence of enhanced activation of TrkB has been identified in the mossy 
fiber pathway in multiple models of limbic epileptogenesis (9, 19). Among potential 
cellular consequences of TrkB activation that might promote limbic epileptogenesis, 
LTP of excitatory synapses on principal neurons is an attractive possibility. We 
therefore asked whether TrkB activation may be required for LTP of the mossy fiber-
CA3 pyramid synapse. To address this question, we analyzed the mossy fiber-CA3 
pyramid synapse in hippocampal slices acutely isolated from WT and TrkB condi-
tional null mutant mice (22). Analyses of the mf-CA3 pyramid synapse in slices 
from TrkB conditional null mutants revealed paired pulse facilitation (PPF) of the 
fEPSP similar to that found in slices of WT mice. By contrast, the increase of the 
fEPSP induced by high frequency stimulation of the mossy fibers was reduced by 
approximately 60% in slices from TrkB conditional null mutant mice compared to 
WT littermate controls, thereby demonstrating a requirement for TrkB in LTP of the 
mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid synapse. Preventing LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid 
synapse may be one mechanism by which the conditional deletion of TrkB prevents 
epileptogenesis in the kindling model (18)."

6 Perspective and Questions Arising 
It seems likely that the “gatekeeper” function assigned to the dentate granule cells of 
hippocampal formation does serve to limit seizure propagation through the normal 
entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry. It further seems plausible that plasticity of the 
granule cell synapses contributes to the impaired gatekeeper function evident in 
epilepsy models. We suspect that the enhanced functional connectivity involves LTP 
of the mossy fiber synapse with CA3 pyramids as well as a compromise of the mossy 
fiber-evoked feedforward inhibition of the CA3 pyramids. With respect to the latter, 
the compromise of the feedforward inhibition is likely mediated by death of the 
spiny interneurons in stratum lucidum in some models of epilepsy (e.g. status epilep-
ticus models). In other models of limbic epilepsy where these interneurons survive, 
we suspect that LTD of the mossy fiber synapse with these interneurons may con-
tribute. 
That said, the perspective advanced above raises a series of important questions. 
Starting with plasticity of these synapses, what is the signaling cascade triggered by 
TrkB activation that leads to LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell synapse? 
What is the cellular locale at which the TrkB must be activated, a mossy fiber bouton 
or CA3 dendritic spine? Is BDNF the key ligand activating TrkB? How does TrkB 
signaling interact with identified molecules required for LTP of the mossy fiber-CA3 
pyramid synapse including GluR6, EphB2 receptor, Rab3a, PKA, RIM1α, and other 
signaling proteins (37)? Also unclear is whether TrkB signaling is required for LTD 
of the mossy fiber synapses with interneurons in stratum lucidum. With respect to 
the gatekeeper function and its proposed defects, the in vitro studies provide a strong 
rationale for testing the integrity of the “dentate gate” in vivo in animal models of 
limbic epilepsy. Addressing this question is entirely feasible using multiple elec-
trodes recording local field potentials and single unit activity in entorhinal cortex and 
various hippocampal regions in chronic models. This will permit testing not only the 
integrity or lack thereof of the dentate gate but also the potential role of temporoam-
monic projections directly to CA1 in propagation of seizure from entorhinal cortex 
(4). Finally, developing causal inference as to the role of the granule cells and their 
synapses in epileptogenesis in vivo will be facilitated by engineering mice in which 
gene expression can be selectively and conditionally regulated in the dentate granule 
cells of the mature animal. This will permit a determination of how regulating activ-
ity of granule cells as well as plasticity of their synapses impacts epileptogenesis in 
vivo.

Stroke – A Synaptic Perspective 
Robert Meller and Roger P. Simon 
1 Introduction 
Evolving data implicate the synapse in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury and 
stroke. Ischemic conditions in the brain induce profound changes in synaptic 
function and synaptic morphology, which may account for early functional loss and 
deficits observed following stroke. A better understanding of the effects of ischemia 
on the synapse may help guide novel therapeutic approaches to reduce brain damage 
and aid in the recovery of function following a stroke. 
2 Introduction to Stroke 
2.1 The Challenge of Stroke 
Stroke accounts for one in every 16 deaths in the United States (2004), making it the 
third most common cause of death after heart disease and cancer. Stroke is the 
leading cause of long-term disability, because 76% of people survive their stroke 
(14). The economic burden of stroke is huge, $63 billion dollars in 2007. Part of the 
challenge facing stroke research is the multifaceted etiology of the disorder in 
humans, with many cerebrovascular, cardiac and metabolite risk factors contributing 
to the condition. 
2.2 Classification of Stroke 
Stroke is the clinical syndrome resulting from impaired blood flow in the brain due 
to local disturbances in cerebral perfusion, produced by large vessel (thrombotic) or 
small vessel (lacunar) in situ vascular occlusion or occlusion by embolism from a

remote source (9, 103). Transient symptoms (TIA: transient ischemic attack) or 
permanent symptoms (stroke) result from these occlusions. The clinical 
manifestation of the stroke is defined by the region of brain infarcted: unilateral 
weakness with or without impairment of language function being the commonest 
impairment. A focal stroke syndrome may also result from rupture of a blood vessel 
with in the parenchyma of the brain usually as the result of chronic hypertension. 
The basal ganglia is the most common location and unilateral paralysis is the most 
common presentation (46). 
Global brain ischemia occurs when the blood supply to the entire brain is 
reduced, for example following cardiac arrest, or due to raised intracranial pressure 
resulting from the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm (46). Global ischemia 
produces damage in metabolically sensitive and selectively vulnerable brain regions, 
such as the hippocampus, basal ganglia and cortical lamina. Damage to the 
hippocampus has been associated with memory deficits in patients recovering from 
global ischemia (46). 
 
 
Fig. 1. Different types of stroke result in different patterns of damage in the brain. Stoke can 
be caused by a global reduction in global brain perfusion, such as a heart attach or during heart 
bypass surgery. (Left) Global ischemia results in damage to selective metabolically brain 
regions such as the hippocampus (black circled region) and the cortical lamina. Focal 
ischemia can be induced by either a hemorrhage or by local blockade of perfusion, such as 
results from an embolism. Focal stoke results in local damage to the brain resulting in 
functional deficits based on that brain region’s function. (Middle) Following a hemorrhage in 
the brain parenchyma small ischemic regions occur, where as a sub-arachnoid bleed will result 
in the cortical lamina being subject to ischemic conditions. (Right) Ischemia induced by 
embolic stroke in a blood vessel result in wedge shaped pattern of damage to the cortical and 
sub cortical regions which receive their greatest blood flow from the occluded vessel."

2.3 Therapeutic Management of Stroke 
Each type of ischemic event requires different clinical management: symptomatic 
ischemia of thrombotic, embolic, or lacunar etiology may improve clinically by 
administration of thrombolytic therapy (tissue plasminogen activator: tPA) begun 
within three hours of the onset of symptoms (1). This is a so-called “clot-busting 
drug”, which will aid the dissolution of a clot. This treatment is counter indicated in 
hemorrhagic stroke. No neuroprotective drugs to preserve or protect brain 
parenchyma are currently available and approved by the FDA. Unfortunately with 
the recent failure of the SAINT II trial (Stroke Acute Ischemic NXY-059 Treatment), 
interest in spin trap reagents (free radical scavengers) has been reduced (101, 102). 
Given the increasing prevalence of stroke in the community, which may be related to 
the increasing population age, it seems imperative that additional therapeutic options 
be identified.  
2.4 Experimental Models to Study Stroke and Ischemia – In vivo Models 
of Stroke 
There are multiple experimental models used to study stroke, because of this caution 
is needed in interpreting sometimes conflicting results from different models. 
Different studies may employ different techniques of inducing ischemia, different 
species or strain of experimental animals, different brain regions for study and 
differing techniques to determine infarction area/volume and functional effects. 
Experimental ischemia can be permanent, or transient (temporary) whereby the cause 
of reduced perfusion is removed, i.e. withdrawal of an occluding filament. 
Focal ischemic models attempt to recapitulate the situation of disrupted local 
blood flow to a specific area of the brain. Probably the most common model is the 
filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. While commonly used, due to the 
ease of controlling the reperfusion of the tissue, filament insertion may exacerbate 
injury following ischemia due to damage to the vascular endothelium (25). Other 
focal models include electro-coagulation and chemical-coagulation of blood vessels 
(112) on the surface of the brain. While similar to human stroke the duration of 
ischemia is more variable in these models, and distal thrombosis may induce 
secondary infarctions. As an alternative, endothelin-1 has been used to induce 
constriction in the cerebral blood vessels, which can be reversed by an antagonist, 
The nature of damage following focal and global ischemia, as well as the 
development of damage (progressive vs. completed) is determined by the choice of 
model used to study ischemia. Global ischemia models are performed to reduce 
blood flow to the entire brain. Common models are the 2-vessel occlusion (whereby 
the bilateral carotid arteries are clamped and systemic blood pressure reduced) or 4-
vessel occlusion (most commonly used in rat) whereby the vertebral arteries are 
permanently occluded by ligature or cauterizing and then the carotid arteries are 
transiently occluded by aneurysm clips (95, 113). Some studies have employed a 
cardiac arrest model whereby the heart is stopped for a varing duration (by KCl 
injection), and then resuscitated (chest compressions, intravenous epinephrine, and 
ventilation with 100% O2)."

thereby reducing filament damage to the vasculature endothelium (54). (For a review 
of ischemia models see (14, 113)). 
2.5 Experimental Models to Study Stroke and Ischemia – In vitro 
Models of Ischemia 
Most studies of in vitro ischemia utilize primary cultures of cortical or hippocampal 
cells (18), although immortalized neuronal and neuronal like cells have been used 
(55, 56). These cultures however vary between study groups, regarding age of 
cultures, growth media, species (mouse vs. rat) and date of tissue preparation 
(embryonic vs. post-natal). Most studies focus on the effects of ischemia on neuronal 
cell populations, however in vitro systems can be used to study astrocyte and 
oligodendrocyte responses (4, 40). Of note while in general astrocytes tend to show 
higher resilience to ischemia than neurons, protoplasmic astrocytes may have a 
similar vulnerability to ischemia as neurons (40). Organotypic slices have also been 
used for the study of ischemia. 
There are a number of methods to mimic ischemic conditions. Hypoxia/anoxia 
can be induced by placing cells in a solution where oxygen is removed or lowered by 
bubbling the solution with an anaerobic gas mixture or by placing cells into a 
hypobaric/anoxic chamber (80). Hypoglycemia can be modeled by the removal of 
glucose, or its replacement with a non-metabolized variant (2-deoxy glucose) (115). 
Mitochondrial inhibitors, for example potassium cyanide or 3-nitopropionic acid 
(115, 117), have been used to model the metabolic inhibition that occurs following 
ischemia,. Ischemia also induces glutamate release and excitotoxicity, hence many 
studies have focused on the effects of high concentrations of glutamate or the 
selective agonist N- methyl-D Aspartate (NMDA).  
2.6 Physiology and Biochemistry of Brain Ischemia 
Ischemic conditions in the brain rapidly deplete neurons, and to a lesser extent 
astrocytes, of the metabolites oxygen and glucose that are necessary for energy 
production. Energy loss results in a rundown of the electrochemical gradients of ions 
across membranes, notably Ca2+ and K+, leading to depolarization of cells and 
neurotransmitter release (59). The rapid rise in intracellular calcium, via influx from 
voltage and ligand-gated calcium ion channels can activate calcium sensitive 
proteases such as calpain and cathepsin resulting in protein degradation. 
The brain, when subject to focal ischemia, can be divided into two regions. The 
portion of the brain subject to the most extreme ischemic conditions exhibits rapid 
cell death and is termed the ischemic core. The region surrounding the ischemic core 
is termed the penumbra. The penumbra is also vulnerable to ischemia-induced cell 
damage but cell death evolves over a slower time course. The slower progression of 
cell death enables the penumbra to be salvaged by attenuating neurochemical cell 
death processes. In this regard, ischemia activates a complex series of biochemical 
and molecular processes in the core and penumbra, which have been covered 
extensively in a number of reviews (28, 34, 45, 69, 76); the following is a brief 
overview."
414,"===== Page 5 =====
Stroke-A Synaptic Perspective 
735
 
 
 
In the ischemic core, the combined loss of energy and ion gradients results in 
cell swelling, compromising the cell membrane and leading to the release of cell 
constituents and cell death. The mitochondria of cells in the ischemic core show 
swelling and rupture of contents. Associated with this rapid passive cell death is an 
accompanying inflammatory response. Released cell constituents (K+ and glutamate) 
may then cause a cascade effect resulting in further damage to adjacent cells. Raised 
extracellular K+ can also induce the release of glutamate from astrocytes via reversal 
of uptake transporters (24). Extracellular glutamate may evoke calcium mediated 
glutamate release from astrocytes (104). Hence once these conditions of high 
extracellular glutamate and potassium are obtained, they can overwhelm 
compensatory mechanisms leading to excitotoxic “necrotic” cell death.  
 
 
Fig. 2. Ischemia induced excitotoxicity. Glutamate excitotoxicty is implicated in the cell 
damage following ischemic conditions. Excessive extracellular glutamate results in prolonged 
NMDA receptor activation leading to calcium overload in the cells. Calcium can activate 
Nitric oxide synthase leading to NO production and the generation of oxygen radicals and 
peroxynitrite. Calcium can also lead to the activation of proteases, protein kinases and 
phosphatases. Once a critical threashold is reached, bcl-2 proteins are activated and translocate 
 
In contrast to the ischemic core, cells in the penumbra show transient damage 
and can die by programmed cell death mechanisms. Following reperfusion to these 
cells, oxidative stress and the release of free radicals can drive lipid peroxidation and 
membrane damage. Stress-activated protein kinases initiate the activation of 
intracellular signaling cascades associated with apoptosis/programmed cell death. 
The activation of the pro-cell death protein Bax compromises the mitochondria 
membrane resulting in the release of cytochrome c and other apoptosis-inducing 
factors, including AIF (apoptosis inducing factor) and SMAC/Diablo (second 
to the mitochondria, resulting in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and release of 
apoptogenic factors cytochrome C and AIF. Cytochrome C can then interact with APAF-1 to 
initiate the caspase cascade which ultimately results in cell death."

mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP-binding protein with low PI) 
which neutralizes IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) (13, 41, 63, 68). Released 
mitochondrial cytochrome C interacts with APAF-1 (Apoptotic Protease Activating 
Factor-1) and ATP (adenosine 5’ triphosphate) to form the apoptosome, which 
catalyzes the cleavage and subsequent activation of the caspase family of proteolytic 
enzymes.  
The initiator caspase, caspase 9 is directly activated by the apoptosome and can 
then cleave and activate caspase 3, which can further cleave and activate executioner 
caspases (caspases 6, 7 and 8). Caspase 3 also cleaves ICAD (inhibitor of CAD), 
resulting in the activation of CAD (caspase activated deoxynuclease), which cleaves 
DNA into regular sized packages (50–300-kb). These biochemical cascades and 
subsequent DNA damage render the cells committed to die. The complex nature of 
this cell death cascade reveals many potential therapeutic targets, although to date 
none have been used successfully in clinical trials (76).  
3 Evidence Implicating the Synapse in Mediating Ischemia-
Induced Brain Damage 
3.1 Synaptically Released Glutamate Mediates Excitotoxicity Following 
Ischemia 
Early work on the retina showed that excessive levels of the excitatory amino acid 
aspartate resulted in brain damage and neurodegeneration termed excitotoxicity (87). 
Excitotoxicity due to excessive brain glutamate levels was suggested as a potential 
mechanism of injury in stroke and other acute/chronic neurological disorders (77). 
Two pieces of evidence strongly support the role of the synapse in mediating the 
effect of ischemia. First, it was shown that cutting the pre-synaptic inputs to the CA1 
region of the hippocampus blocks global ischemia induced neurodegeneration (11) 
and that ischemia induced cell death in vitro is attenuated by blocking synaptic 
release of glutamate with tetanus toxin (85) Second, glutamate receptor antagonists 
attenuate ischemia-induced brain damage in animal models of global ischemia and 
stroke (78). Indeed, this latter observation initiated the large interest in NMDA and 
glutamate receptor acting drugs as potential therapeutics for stroke.  
3.2 NMDA Receptor Antagonists as a Therapy for Stroke: Potential and 
Pitfalls 
Since these initial experiments, glutamate receptor blocking agents have been shown 
to be effective in reducing ischemia induced brain damage in a variety of species 
(rat, mouse, hamster, gerbil, cat, primate) and ischemia models (focal, global 
temporary permanent and in vitro models). However, it should be noted that some of 
the neuroprotective effects of MK801 may be due to its ability to reduce body 
temperature (61). Yet it is of note that even though it is over thirty years since the 
initial experiments proving that blockade of excitatory amino acid receptors blocks 
ischemia induced brain damage, not a single compound has to date been successful"

enough in clinical trials to be approved for general clinical use (although the NMDA 
antagonist memantine was approved for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease by the 
FDA in 2003) (61).  
The reasons behind this apparent failure of glutamate antagonists in clinical 
stroke trials may be due to multiple factors, including the time window of efficacy, 
pH modulation of the ligand gated ion channel (low pH in ischemia may reduce 
channel function) and acute toxicity of the compounds. Furthermore some NMDA 
blocking compounds show unacceptable side effects such a psychosis (ketamine) or 
vacuolation of the brain (MK801: dizocilpine) (51). One significant issue is the that 
time window for therapeutic NMDAR blockade, at least in rodents is slender, up to 
one hour following the ischemic event (97). Such a short therapeutic time window 
makes it unlikely that a patient presenting with stroke symptoms will be given an 
NMDA blocking compound within the effective time range. Indeed this may also be 
a reason for the failure of the SAINT II trial of free radical blocking agents in stroke 
(101). However, one potential solution is to identify therapeutic combinations that 
extend the therapeutic time window of NMDA receptor antagonists. It has recently 
been shown that combination of an ASIC1 receptor blocker PcTX (see previous 
chapter) with the NMDA antagonist memantine enhanced the therapeutic time 
window of the NMDA blocker following ischemia (92). This suggests that 
combinations of neuroprotective agents may provide more effective therapeutic 
options for treating stroke than a single compound alone. Indeed this approach has 
proved effective in cancer therapy, whereby multiple cytotoxic compounds are 
combined.  
The failure in clinical trials of NMDA receptor antagonists and the SAINT trial 
also highlight some of the limitations of studies assessing neuroprotective potential 
of an agents using in vivo models of stroke. For example, in in vivo models the test 
agent is frequently administered at the time of ischemia induction, rather than at time 
points more equivalent to clinical response times (3–6 hours post ischemia). As such, 
numerous recommendations have been made from the review of failed clinical trials 
of neuroprotective agents with recommendations for future studies (27, 35, 101, 
102).  
3.3 Physiological and Pathological NMDA Receptor Signaling: Cell Fate 
in the Balance 
Another compelling reason for the apparent failure of NMDA antagonists concerns 
the apparent Yin/Yang effects of NMDA receptor signaling. On the one hand, 
activation of NMDA receptors has been shown to mediate pro-survival physiological 
effects, such as CREB transcription factor activation and BDNF expression (50, 
116). 
However, 
excessive 
activation 
of 
NMDA 
receptors 
promotes 
neurodegeneration and cell death. In a series of experiments, Biegnon showed that 
the prolonged blockade of NMDA receptors is detrimental if administered hours 
following traumatic brain injury. Indeed, administration of a low dose of NMDA 
agonist (NMDA) results in less brain damage than the administration of the NMDA 
antagonist MK801 in the TBI-injured mice (6)."

R. Meller and R.P. Simon 
 
The results of the Beignon study leads to two intriguing suggestions. First, that a 
weak partial agonist of NMDA receptors may actually be a more therapeutically 
effective therapy. A weak partial agonist would antagonize excessive endogenous 
activation of a given receptor, yet maintain a low level of tonic activation of the 
receptor if endogenous activation falters. This approach is currently in clinical trials; 
the NMDA antagonist memantine may be a weak partial agonist.  
The second suggestion regards the nature of NMDA receptors and their 
contribution to physiological and pathological signaling. Hardingham showed that 
following blockade of synaptic receptors on neurons, further NMDA stimulation 
resulted in toxicity, which was attributed to the activation of extra-synaptic receptors 
(49, 50). Other groups have shown that NMDA toxicity is not blocked by loss of 
spines (100), e.g. following the removal of dendritic spines with latrunculin (an actin 
de-stabilizing agent). These data suggest that toxic NMDA signaling exists when 
either synaptic NMDA receptors are blocked or following removal of dendritic 
spines (and presumably the synaptic receptors). This implies that toxic NMDA 
signaling is mediated through extra-synaptic NMDA receptors.   
However, ischemia induced excitotoxicity may exert its toxic signaling effects 
through synaptic NMDA receptors, and not extrasynaptic receptors. For example, 
removal of dendritic spine heads, following exposure of neurons to the actin 
depolymerizing agent latrunculin, blocks ischemia-induced cell death in vitro (100). 
This suggests that ischemia induced cell death may be reliant on synaptic signaling 
mechanisms and synaptic NMDA receptors that are activated by endogenous 
synaptic glutamate that is released during energy failure. This concept is supported 
by the observation that cutting pre-synaptic inputs to the CA1 neurons of the 
hippocampus blocks ischemia-induced neurodegeneration (11). Furthermore 
blocking synaptically released glutamate with tetrodotoxin blocks oxygen glucose 
modeled ischemia induced cell death in vitro (85). However what is not clear from 
the experiments of Sattler et al. (100) is what happens to synaptic NMDA receptor 
subunits following latrunculin treatment, and whether latrunculin induces changes to 
all NMDA receptors, or whether its effects are subtype specific (NR2A vs. NR2B).  
In a recent study it was suggested that blockade of NR2B subunits, irrespective 
of synaptic location mediates neurotoxic NMDA-receptor mediated signaling, but 
NR2A subunits were pro-survival. This suggests that selective enhancement of 
NR2A, but reduction of NR2B mediated signaling may offer a new therapeutic 
mechanism for stroke. Unfortunatly, the polyamine site NR2B glutamate receptor 
subunit selective antagonist Eliprodil was withdrawn from clinical trials in 1997, 
reducing the enthusiasm of NR2B subunit selective NMDA receptor antagonists as a 
therapeutic option for stroke (see (120)). Hence the challenge for one future direction 
of neurprotective stroke research is to devise a mechanism whereby physiological 
signaling can be maintained, but toxic NMDA signaling can be selectively 
attenuated. Interestingly, endogenous protective mechanisms may indeed mimic this 
situation, and are considered later on in the chapter.  
Taken together the role of the synapse in mediating ischemia induced damage to 
neurons is implicated by a number of studies, but ischemia can also result in 
profound changes to the synapse. These mechanisms may be part of a 
neuroprotective response to the ischemia, or a result of excitotoxic signaling."

Fig. 3. Different signaling modes of NMDA receptors. Synaptic NMDA receptors appear 
essential for physiological roles of NMDA in neurotransmission. Synaptic NMDA receptors 
may mediate ischemia induced cell death, in contrast to NMDA, which activates extrasynaptic 
NMDA receptors. Following ischemic preconditioning, NMDA receptors show reduced toxic 
signaling, but maintain physiological function. 
4 Effect of Ischemia on Synaptic Morphology 
The physical loss of neurons following an injurious ischemic episode will result 
defective brain function. However, synaptic changes are evident in areas subject to 
non-harmful ischemic where the loss of function can be temporary or reversible. The 
form and function of the synapse are intertwined, for simplicity we consider the 
effect of ischemia on synaptic morphological and then the effect of ischemia on 
synaptic function.  
4.1 Methods to Study Synaptic Structure Following Ischemia 
Structural studies have been performed using both in vitro and in vivo stroke models 
to determine the morphological effects of ischemia. In vitro studies have allowed the 
“real time” assessment of dendritic structures through the application of fluorescence 
and confocal microscopy. Typically immunocytochemistry, fluorescent proteins, 
tagged actin or lipophilic fluorescent membrane dyes are used in these studies. In 
vivo studies have commonly used fixed sections to assess morphology either by 
confocal imaging, or electron microscopy. However, recently “real time” imaging of 
live neurons expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in layer V of the mouse 
cortex was reported (124).  
4.2 Ischemia Induces Rapid Dendritic Spine Loss and Morphological 
Changes to Neurons 
Long periods of ischemia induces neurons and other cells in the brain to die, whereas 
briefer ischemic periods may not be toxic. The initial response of neurons to both 
lethal and sub-lethal ischemia is similar regardless of the technique and model 
system used: ischemia induces a rapid loss of dendritic spines and an increase in 
varicosity formation along the dendrite. Spine loss can occur as quickly at 10"

minutes following the onset of ischemia (124). The spine loss is recoverable if the 
ischemia is transient and non-harmful, but is persistent when toxic levels of ischemia 
occur (88, 124). It should be noted however that neurons in the penumbral region 
that recover spines may yet be lost at a later time point. The recovery of spines takes 
approximately 2–4 hours (88). Interestingly the recovery of the spines occurs at the 
same location on the dendrites that the spines were originally lost both in vitro (52) 
and in vivo (124). Spine loss is similar when toxic and non-toxic ischemia or 
excitotoxic stimuli are used, leading to the suggestion that spine loss may be a 
protective phenotype (see later).  
 
 
Fig. 4. Overview of effect of ischemia on synapse structure. Following ischemia various 
modifications to synaptic structrure have been noted, including, temporary swelling of pre-
synaptic boutons and astrocytes. The post-synaptic regions show more profound changes, 
including loss of dendrites, disassembly of actin cytoskeleton and receptor scaffolds. 
Microtubules are cleaved and accumulate in varicosities along with swollen mitochondria."

Stroke-A Synaptic Perspective

The mechanisms regulating spine loss following ischemia have not been 
thoroughly studied, rather many studies have focused on the mechanisms of NMDA-
induced morphological changes. NMDA activates protein phosphatase 2B, 
calcineurin, which causes actin depolymerization and may be responsible in part for 
spine loss. However, actin depolymerization alone is insufficient to remove spines 
from dendrites. Latrunculin treatment of hippocampal cells results in a loss of the 
spine head, but the shaft is still evident (100). In contrast, incubation of hippocampal 
cells with NMDA results in loss of the entire spine (44, 52, 53). This suggests 
additional mechanisms are responsible for the spine loss and rather than just actin 
remodeling. Interestingly, latrunculin treatment does prevent spine recovery 
following NMDA treatment (52).  
NMDA may regulate spines via the activation of proteolytic enzymes. NMDA-
mediated activation of the proteolytic enzyme cathepsin D degrades MARCKS: a 
protein, which is responsible for anchoring the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma 
membrane (44). Calpain however does not regulate spine loss, but calpain blockers 
slow the recovery of spines following NMDA treatment (32). The ubiquitin-
proteasome system may also play a role in the loss of MARCKs following brief 
ischemia, and contribute to synaptic remodeling (Meller: unpublished results). This 
suggests that brief ischemia may remodel the synapse via the selective degradation 
of actin-associated elements.   
4.3 Varicosity Formation in Neuronal Dendrites Following Ischemia 
A second feature following ischemia is the appearance of beaded varicosities along 
the dendrites. These varicosities have been reported in response to excitotoxic 
stimuli and were originally considered cell death indicators resulting from 
excitotoxicity (86). The varicosities occur in the same time period as spine loss is 
observed (88). Interestingly, more varicosities are observed on proximal dendrites 
following ischemia, than those in close proximity to the cell soma (Meller; 
unpublished observations). Microtubule associated proteins (MAP2A/MAP2B etc.) 
have been shown to be cleaved following ischemia, and they accumulate into the 
varicosites (12). The formation of varicosities following ischemia is not inhibited by 
a calpain inhibtor, MDL 28, 170, however the recovery of varicosities following 
NMDA treatment was slowed in the presence of MDL28,170(32). More recent data 
show that varicosity formation and excitotoxic cell death occur through independent 
mechanisms; death is Ca+2 mediated while varicosities are mediated by Na+2 flux and 
AMPA internalization (64). The functional consequence of varicosity formation is 
not clear, but may also serve as a protective function, as they may help 
compartmentalize calcium to reduce calcium overload (64). Indeed, varicosity 
formation by NMDA induces a transient, reversible neuroprotective state by 
attenuating excitatory neurotransmission (64). Thus the varicosity formation as well 
as spine loss following ischemia may be part of a protective response."

5 Ultrastructural Changes in the Brain Following Ischemia 
A number of ultrastructural studies have helped to shed light on the effect of global 
ischemia on selectively vulnerable neurons, especially damage to the CA1 pyramidal 
neurons of the hippocampus. Most of these studies involve observations made on 
brain sections prepared for electron microscopy.  
5.1 Presynaptic Membranes are Tolerant of Ischemia 
Pre-synaptic membranes are not as affected by global ischemia as the post synaptic 
surface. The pre-synaptic membrane and glia show temporary swelling, which is 
reversible within one hour (31, 57). This is consistent with the lack of permanent cell 
damage to astrocytes and pre-synaptic neurons in global ischemia models (67, 82). 
One common observation is that astrocyte end feet are swollen, and appear to reduce 
the extracellular space (31), which may have implications for synaptic transmission. 
Following ischemia, vesicle aggregation is observed in pre-synaptic terminals, and 
some synaptic boutons show a reduction in vesicle number (31, 118). This may 
correlate to ischemia/reperfusion induced vesicular release of glutamate, and other 
transmitters. The morphological changes to the pre-synaptic terminal and astrocytes 
appear temporary and return to relatively normal levels within one to three hours 
following the ischemic insult.  
Further support for the robustness of the pre-synaptic neurons in global ischemia 
comes from multiple experiments, and not just ultra-structural studies. Global 
ischemia induces cell death in the CA1 field of the hippocampus but not the 
innervating cells. Following global ischemia, potassium evoked glutamate release 
can still be measured using microdialysis a few days after the ischemic insult (82). 
Histological analysis of these brains show that the post-synaptic cells were lost, but 
the pre-synaptic axons appear to withstand the ischemic shock. In a study by 
Hasbani, the pre-synaptic labeled cells appear relatively stable, following exposure 
to NMDA (52). In comparison the post synaptic dendritic spine shrinks, but 
reappears following wash out of the NMDA. This apparent robustness of pre-
synaptic boutons to ischemia may also serve to guide dendritic spines back to their 
original contacts. However, one week following global ischemia pre-synaptic bouton 
numbers are reduced, which may be due to a lack of target sites in fields where 
neurons have degenerated (58).  
5.2 Postsynaptic Membranes are Vulnerable to Ischemia 
Ischemia induces more morphological defects in the post-synaptic region, compared 
to the pre-synaptic terminal. Following ischemia, modifications of the post-synaptic 
density (PSD) have been reported, including projections of electron dense material 
(the consequence of this is as yet unclear). The PSD becomes irregular following the 
ischemic insult. The PSD is thicker and discontinuous 20–60 minutes following 
reperfusion (31). Apparent breaks in the PSD correspond to the breaks in the post-
synaptic membrane at 1 hour. A disruption or compromise of the post-synaptic 
membrane is consistent with the observation that post-synaptic sites take up"
422,"===== Page 13 =====
Stroke-A Synaptic Perspective 
743
 
 
 
exogenous HRP (horse radish peroxidase) following ischemia (although the HRP is 
associated with cell membranes and so may be due to endocytotic mechanisms rather 
than cell lysis) (26). The potential of post fixation to induce the membrane breaks 
should also be considered. One unusual observation (albeit with unknown 
significance) is the formation of pockets in the post-synaptic membrane, which are 
filled by the pre-synaptic membrane, but no PSD is present in the “buckets “ (31).  
One hour following ischemia, many studies report the swelling of post-synaptic 
membranes and changes in the morphology of internal organelles: mitochondria 
appear swollen with a loss of the cristae, the endoplasmic reticulum appears swollen, 
vacuoles form in the cytoplasm and poly-ribosomes are disintegrated into single 
units (31, 57, 118). Some cells also start to show signs of chromatin clumping 
following ischemia. Microtubules in axons and dendrites also appear to show 
kinking and breaks following ischemia, which may correspond to the formation of 
varicosities (see above).  
The thickening of the post synaptic density in ischemic-vulnerable CA1 
hippocampal neurons can last 4–24 hours following global ischemia, where as in the 
dentate gyrus (which is less vulnerable to ischemia) changes in the PSD thickness 
reverse 24 hours following the ischemic insult (74). This thickening of the PSD may 
correspond to an enhanced NMDA receptor mediated facilitation (signaling) 
following ischemia in CA1 neurons or be associated with ischemic damage to the 
post-synaptic region. Hence the persistent modification of the PSD may be a marker 
or a cause of the delayed cell loss in the CA1 following global ischemia.  
The thickening of the PSD following ischemia may also involve the denaturation 
of proteins. Ubiquitinated protein aggregates have been reported to occur following 
ischemia, especially in synaptic preparations (70). If proteins are present but 
denatured (62), this may lead to a decrease in signaling function of synaptic proteins. 
Since multiple proteins in the post-synaptic density are targets for ubiquitination 
(30), this may affect post synaptic receptor signaling following ischemia. 
Fewer studies have investigated long term changes to the structure of the brain 
following harmful ischemia. There is evidence to support reinnervation of some 
areas lost following an ischemic insult. One week following ischemia there is a 
persistent decrease in synaptic number in the hippocampus. In particular there is a 
reduced number of asymmetrical synapses, which correlate with excitatory synapses 
(58). However there is an increase in glutamate in the remaining synaptic boutons of 
the hippocampus, which may be a compensatory mechanism for the initial loss of 
cells following ischemia (58). In the short-term, presynaptic markers levels (GAP43) 
do not change following ischemia, but at 2 weeks changes were apparent (increased 
protein expression) (47, 71). This may coincide with reinnervation of damaged areas 
or a recovery in function. Recently, realtime in vivo two-photon imaging has 
demonstrated up to 5-fold higher rates of spine formation in neurons near the infarct 
borders (10). It is notable that the brain is capable of recovering function following 
the loss of discrete brain regions due to ischemia."

6 Functional Effects of Ischemia on Synaptic Transmission  
Many studies have been performed using global ischemia to determine the effects of 
harmful ischemia on synaptic transmission (123). Such studies are performed using 
the global model of ischemia, where the maturation of injury in the vulnerable CA1 
region of the can be compared to dentate gyrus or CA3 cells, which are resistant to 
the effects of ischemia. While it is assumed that regions of the brain exposed to 
hypoxic conditions will show greatest functional deficits following ischemia, it is of 
note that in a receptor study Zhang and Murphy showed that functional deficits 
extended on average up to 400 µm from areas with damaged dendrites indicating 
synaptic function may even be compromised in the structurally intact penumbra 
(125). 
6.1 Rapid Onset of Synaptic Depression During Ischemia 
When cells are subject to hypoxia there is an initial depression or failure of synaptic 
transmission (108). This may be due to the rapid energy deletion in the cells 
following the onset of ischemic conditions. The synaptic depression is reversible if 
the duration of ischemia is short. The CA1 cells of the hippocampus show a rapid 
decrease in population spike response to stimulation following ischemia, compared 
to dentate gyrus cells.  
6.2 Anoxia-Induced Spreading Depression 
If ischemia is prolonged the cells suffer a spreading depression type event, which has 
some similarities to normoxic spreading depression (108). Interestingly while some 
drugs are able to delay the time of onset of spreading depression in brain slices, no 
drugs have been shown to produce blockade (108). The consequence of this period 
of depolarization is not fully understood but may play a role in the post ischemic 
enhancement of synaptic transmission. The ability of the brain to recover from this 
depolarization is inversely proportional to the time exposed to spreading depression 
(108). The timing of the spreading depression may contribute to two features of post 
ischemic responses. First the spreading depression may result in excessive release of 
the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, which may activate NMDA receptors 
leading to enhanced intracellular calcium levels. Second, the spreading depression 
may also account for some of the post-ischemic abnormalities in synaptic 
transmission. 
Following recovery from ischemia the neuronal responses may appear normal or 
enhanced, but drop off between 8 and 24 hours following ischemia, a time interval 
that corresponds to that of CA1 neuronal loss. It must be noted that this mechanism 
of cells dieing off after a period of re-perfusion in global ischemic models is distinct 
from the cell death following irreversible immediate hypoxic damage usually 
observed in the core of a focal ischemic infarct (commonly referred to apoptosis vs. 
necrosis, but see (106)). Following global ischemia, there is a temporary decrease in 
inhibitory synaptic transmission, but this is not as prolonged as the enhancement of 
excitatory transmission (15)."

Stroke-A Synaptic Perspective 
745
 
 
 
6.3 Enhanced Postsynaptic Responses Following Ischemia 
Prolonged post-synaptic glutamate receptor activation may result in an apparent 
increase in EPSP amplitude up to 12 hours following an ischemic episode (21, 22, 
37, 38, 83). Enhanced NMDA responses have been termed post ischemic long term 
potentiation, in that it shows some similarities to long term potentiation induced by a 
tetanic stimulation under normoxic conditions. The potentiation is due to the 
increased synaptic efficiency in post ischemic hippocampal CA1 neurons following 
ischemia. Post ischemic LTP can be blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists, which 
may account for the ability of some glutamate antagonist studies to show a reduction 
in cell damage when administered following global ischemia (84). Calcium chelating 
agents can also block post ischemic LTP, but unlike tetanic LTP AMPA antagonists 
are not effective (21).  
A number of mechanisms may account for the enhanced response of NMDA 
receptors following ischemia. Ischemia decreases ATP, changes pH, increases 
glycine release, activates protein kinases (PKC) and results in reducing conditions, 
all of which have been shown to enhance NMDA receptor currents (21). Some 
studies suggest that the increased expression of the NMDA receptor 2C subunit 
(NR2C) following ischemia may account for enhanced NMDA responses (66, 107). 
NR2C subunits have a reduced magnesium blockade of the channel resulting in 
enhanced calcium influx and prolonged opening of the channel. Hypoxic LTP 
requires a strong depolarizing event to be induced, and one potential candidate could 
be anoxic spreading depression, which is observed following ischemia.  
The enhanced NMDA response in CA1 regions may also lead to additional 
complications in the brain following stroke. Following ischemia there is an increased 
occurrence of epileptic seizures. NMDA receptors regulate burst firing in the CA1 
post ischemic, but in some recent studies the CA3 was shown to have a lowered 
seizure threshold following global ischemia (19). Enhanced seizure susceptibility 
occurs 2–3 weeks following the primary ischemic insult. 
6.4 Changes in NMDA Receptors Following Ischemia 
Following global ischemia there is a reduced expression of NMDA receptor subunits 
(123) which probably correlates with the loss of cells from the CA1 following injury. 
These decreases are blocked by administration of NMDA receptor antagonists at the 
time of ischemia (again supporting the view that ischemia induced cell death 
involves excitotoxicity). Following ischemia there is also a calpain sensitive 
cleavage of the NR2A and NR2B receptor subunit C termini (39, 121), which may 
also enhance receptor signaling. Interestingly the post ischemic induction of LTP, 
cell death and reduction of NR2B subunits is blocked by the NMDA receptor 2B 
subunit selective antagonist ifenprodil (91). Other studies have reported that NR2B 
mediated signaling is toxic (50).  
The interaction of the NMDA receptor with the postsynaptic scaffold may also 
result in enhanced NMDA function. Following ischemia there is an increased 
phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits by the tyrosine kinases Src Fyn, and 
Pyk (17). The phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B receptor subunits has been"

linked to hyper-excitability of the cell and cell death. Disruption of PSD-95 
interactions with NMDA receptors, or reduction in its expression by antisense 
oligonucleotides reduced NMDA receptor subunit phosphorylation and ischemia 
induced cell death (2, 60). Hence the downstream intracellular signaling components 
of the NMDA receptor scaffold may offer new targets for anti-stroke therapies 
7 Role of the Synapse in Ischemic Tolerance 
Tolerance is the biological phenomenon whereby a brief sub toxic exposure to a 
stimuli (preconditioning) renders the cell, organ or organism protected against a 
normal toxic exposure to the same stimuli. In ischemic tolerance, brief exposure to 
subtoxic ischemia (albeit sufficient to elicit a response in the tissue) renders the brain 
(or heart) tolerant to subsequent normally injurious levels of ischemia (29). The 
protection induced by preconditioning can render the system protected from other 
harmful stimuli as well, for example endotoxin (lipo-poly saccharide¨LPS) can 
induce tolerance to ischemia, and seizures or spreading depression can also induce 
ischemic tolerance (29). Tolerance to ischemia can occur over two time frames, rapid 
tolerance occurs within minutes and lasts approximately one hour, delayed tolerance 
require 24–72 hours to be maximal and is lost after 7 days (29).  
7.1 Multiple Intracellular Mechanisms Regulate Ischemic Tolerance 
Studies of neuroprotection in ischemic tolerance usually revolve around the study of 
an induced protective gene following preconditioning. Central to this is the 
observation that long term ischemic tolerance is blocked by protein synthesis 
inhibitors, which suggests that it requires de-novo protein synthesis (5, 79, 80). 
Long-term ischemic tolerance is also blocked by RNA synthesis inhibitor 
actinomycin D (Meller, unpublished observation). Ischemic tolerance following 
preconditioning with ischemia is inhibited by NMDA receptor antagonists (7, 111), 
but this may be specific to the nature of ischemic preconditioning (i.e. requiring a 
synaptic event).  
Ischemic tolerance induced by ischemic preconditioning is blocked by 
pharmacological and genomic inhibition of Protein Kinase A (PKA), p42/44 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), calcium/calmodulin activated protein 
kinase (CAMK) and AKT (42, 80). Each of these protein kinases have been shown 
to be activated following synaptic activation of NMDA receptors, although the exact 
mechanism linking these protein kinases remains to be determined. Activation of 
these protein kinases has been shown to drive multiple transcription factors and 
CREB activation has been shown by a number of groups to regulate ischemic 
tolerance. Blocking CREB phosphorylation, interaction with CBP or CRE promoters 
has been shown to block ischemic tolerance (48, 80). Interestingly, the prosurvival 
protein bcl-2 contains a CRE promoter (36, 94, 119) and blocking CREB function 
blocks bcl-2 expression and ischemic tolerance (48, 72, 80).  
However, apart from bcl-2, numerous genes and proteins have been touted as 
mediating protection in tolerance paradigms, including heat shock proteins, other"
426,"===== Page 17 =====
Stroke-A Synaptic Perspective 
747
 
 
 
anti-apoptotic proteins e.g. Bcl-w, changes in expression of glutamate transport 
proteins EAAT2/3 and erythropoietin (23, 75, 81, 98, 99). When one considers a 
mechanism for ischemic tolerance, one must take into account the nature of the 
preconditioning agent as well the nature of the harmful event, as this may have lead 
to misleading generalizations regarding common mechanisms of ischemic tolerance. 
For example, induction of heat shock proteins have been shown as a potential 
mechanism of ischemic tolerance (16, 122), but ischemic tolerance is induced at a 
lower insult threashold than required to induce HSP expression (3). This does not 
rule out heat shock proteins as a relevant mechanism of inducing tolerance to 
ischemia, but suggests other mechanisms may be more relevant for spreading 
depression induced protection.  
Many agents may induce long term (protein synthesis dependent) tolerance, 
however the mechanisms by which this tolerance is acquired may be quite different. 
Comparison of the genomic profile of ischemic preconditioning is quite different 
from other preconditioning agents, and no one common mechanism appears to result 
in protection. One potential explanation for this is not that preconditioning agents 
cause the same induction of protective genes, but rather they cause a reprogramming 
in the genomic response to normally harmful ischemia, thereby changing the cells 
fate. This has indeed been shown in ischemic tolerance using microarray profiling. 
Stenzel Poore et al. showed that the genomic overlap of infarcted cortex and tolerant 
cortex subject to harmful ischemia show no common regulated genes (110). Thus the 
genomic response to ischemia was “reprogrammed” by preconditioning the brain by 
brief ischemia and that this reprogramming produced protection. What remains to be 
determined is whether the different preconditioning agents also induce the same 
reprogramming effect or whether each stimuli not only induces its own pattern of 
protective gene expression but also its own re-programming effect, based of the 
genes expressed by the preconditioning agent. Stenzel-Poore has suggested that the 
tolerizing agent (ischemia, LPS) dictates the mechanism of protection to subsequent 
ischemia (109). Ischemic preconditioning induces a hibernation-like phenotype, the 
down regulation of high energy utilizers such as transporters and channels (110). In 
contract LPS down regulated inflammatory mediators and upregulates anti 
inflammatory mediators (109).  
7.2 Is Synaptic Function Changed in Delayed Ischemic Tolerance? 
Since ischemia tolerance induced by ischemic preconditioning can be blocked by 
NMDA receptor antagonists (43, 111), this would suggest that tolerance pathways 
are activated following ischemia-induced activation of NMDA receptors. However, 
no clear pattern of expression of synaptic proteins is induced by preconditioning or 
the tolerant state in microarray studies (110).  
However, preconditioning ischemia may induce changes to synaptic 
transmission via indirect mechanisms. Microinjection of Bcl-XL into pre-synaptic 
terminals enhances post-synaptic responses and the rate of recovery from synaptic 
depression (65). In contrast an N-terminal cleaved Bcl-XL, which is pro-apoptotic, 
reduced post-synaptic responses. The effect of bcl-2 family proteins on the cell may 
depend on the developmental stage of the neuron. Loss of Bak results in reduced"

GABA-ergic inhibition and enhanced seizure-like activity in young mice exposed to 
the excitatory amino acid analogue, kainite (33). However, in mature mice, loss of 
Bak renders cells protected against ischemia (33). Therefore in the case if ischemic 
tolerance, where Bcl-2 expression is increased (8, 80, 105), a change in the balance 
of pro-survival vs. pro cell death proteins may result in changes in mitochondrial 
function and therefore synaptic function.  
Ischemic preconditioning may induce long-term changes to the synapse. A 
recent study reported that 3–30 days following preconditioning ischemia there is a 
higher number of dendritic spines compared to control (20). Increased spine number 
is usually associated with an increase in vulnerability to ischemia and other 
excitotoxic stimuli. This suggests that long-term changes occur in the brain 
following preconditioning, out lasting the neuroprotective period.  
7.3 Rapid Ischemic Tolerance  
Neurons also become tolerant to harmful ischemia one hour following 
preconditioning ischemia: a process termed rapid ischemic tolerance (79, 89, 90, 96). 
This form of tolerance is mediated by biochemical mechanisms in the brain. 
Blocking protein synthesis does not block rapid ischemic tolerance (79), suggesting 
it is not dependent on new protein synthesis. A complement of protein kinases 
appear to mediate rapid ischemic tolerance including p42/44 mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase C (PKC) and AKT (79, 96), but not protein 
kinase A (PKA) or calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase (CAMK) (Meller 
unpublished results).  
7.4 Proteasomal Degradation of Structural Proteins in Rapid Ischemic 
Tolerance Leads to Dendritic Spine Remodeling 
Rapid ischemic tolerance is blocked by inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome 
system (79), which is implicated in the regulation of synaptic signaling (30). Our 
recent studies have identified a number of proteins implicated in post-synaptic 
density regulation and signaling as being ubiquitinated, and potentially degraded one 
hour following preconditioning ischemia. Of particular focus, we identified the actin 
binding proteins MARCKS and fascin as being ubiquitinated and degraded. The loss 
of these proteins appears to result in re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton, 
although rapid acting calcium mediated processes following NMDA receptor 
activation, such as calpain, may also account for some of the rapid re-organization of 
actin.  
A direct consequence of actin reorganization is the loss of dendritic spines on the 
neurons, which are therefore unable to make synaptic contacts. The loss of dendritic 
spines following ischemia has been reported in neurons in vitro following ischemia 
(53), but the role of the ubiquitin proteasome system has not yet been investigated. 
We showed that the proteasome inhibitor reduces the number of spines lost at one 
hour. Whether the proteasome directly mediates spine loss or speeds up the spine 
recovery is currently under investigation."

The loss of dendritic spines may be a feature of endogenous protective mechanisms 
resulting in tolerance to ischemia. A reduction in dendritic spine number has been 
associated with the ischemia tolerant effect of hibernation in artic ground squirrels 
and European hamsters (73, 93, 114). Hence the remodeling of dendritic spines 
following transient sub-toxic ischemia appears to be a protective mechanism.  
7.5 Reduced Excitotoxicity of NMDA in Rapid Ischemic Tolerance 
The remodeling of the post-synaptic membrane may not just be mediated by changes 
to the actin cytoskeleton. The loss of dendritic spines one hour following 
preconditioning ischemia, would no doubt have an effect on synaptic transmission. 
We have also discovered that at the time of spine loss in preconditioned cells, 
NMDA-mediated cell death is reduced. The tolerance to NMDA excitotoxicity is 
blocked by a proteasome inhibitor, which also blocks the reduction in spine number 
at one hour following preconditioning ischemia (See Fig. 5). This suggest that 
preconditioning ischemia results in a selective inhibition of post-synaptic toxic 
glutamate signaling in cells, via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, yet NMDA 
function (CREB phosphorylation) and receptor subunit expression levels were not 
effected by the preconditioning ischemia (not shown).  
The loss of NMDA toxicity following preconditioning ischemia, suggest a 
selective loss in pathological NMDA signaling that may account for the tolerance to 
ischemia. These studies agree with that of Aarts, who showed that disruption of the 
interaction of PSD-95 with NMDA2A/2B receptors blocks ischemia induced cell 
death, but not NMDA electrophysiological responses (2). Further this result agrees 
with Sattler whereby remodeling of dendritic spines results in protection to ischemia 
(100). However in that study, dendritic remodeling using latrunculin (an actin 
depolymerizing agent) only protected against ischemia and not NMDA toxicity. In 
contrast ischemic preconditioning protects against toxicity induced by both ischemia 
and NMDA. Our data suggest that preconditioning induced protection, involves 
more than just actin re-organization, rather the ubiquitination of post-synaptic 
density associated proteins results in a protective phenotype. Hence preconditioning 
cells with ischemia results in protection to toxic NMDA signaling from extra-
synaptic sites as well as synaptically derived ischemia – induced neurotoxicity.  
Summary and Concluding Remarks 
Ischemia induces profound changes to the synapse, both in terms of mediating the 
death of cells following toxic ischemia, and the remodeling of synapses in response 
   
Fig. 5. (Continued) ischemia a reduction in dendritic spine number (arrow heads) and 
increases in varicosity (*) formation is observed (d). Compared to control cells (e), varicosity 
formation (*) is highlighted by an accumulation of MAP2 following preconditioning ischemia 
(f). (g) The loss of spines and the formation of varicosities is blocked by a proteasome 
inhibitor MG132. (h) NMDA tolerance induced by preconditioning (PC) is also blocked by 
the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Taken together we suggest that following preconditioning 
ischemia the protein degradation mediated by the proteasome results in morphological 
changes in the spines, resulting in endogenous protection to excitotoxicity."

physiological from pathological NMDA signaling, potential therapeutic options may 
be identified with significant therapeutic protection from stroke potential and a more 
favorable therapeutic index than currently available investigational tools. Such an 
intervention may be of use post-stroke as well as in situations whereby ischemic 
brain conditions can be predicted, for example heart bypass surgery.

Fig. 2. A model for pain hypersensitivity induced by peripheral nerve injury. Left; Under 
normal conditions, intracellular Cl– concentration is sufficiently low that opening GABAA, or 
glycine, receptors Cl– flows into the dorsal horn nociceptive neurons causing hyperpolarizing 
inhibition that suppresses transmission. Right; After peripheral nerve injury microglia in the 
dorsal horn become activated and upregulate expression of P2X4 receptors, stimulation of 
which causes the microglia to release BDNF. BDNF, acting on TrkB receptors, causes 
downregulation of KCC2 causing intracellular Cl- concentration to increase thereby decreasing 
inhibition of the neurons. 
5 Conclusions and Future Directions 
Overall, it is evident that enhancement of excitatory synaptic responses of projection 
neurons within the nociceptive network within the dorsal horn, directly or through 
suppression of inhibition, is one of the key processes which increases the gain of 
nociceptive transmission and leads to pain hypersensitivity. The elucidation of the 
molecular mechanisms underlying this enhanced transmission has led to potential 
targets for new types of analgesics. It has become apparent that the key molecular 
mechanisms are not restricted to neurons but also involve glial cells in the spinal 
cord, with most of the existing evidence implicating microglia. Thus, understanding 
how microglia-neuron signaling impacts synaptic transmission and plasticity may 
lead to additional new strategies for the diagnosis and management of neuropathic 
pain, strategies not previously anticipated by a view of pain plasticity focused solely 
on neurons."

1 Recycling of Synaptic Vesicles and Their Proteins 
1.1 Introduction 
Chemical neurotransmission is the major means of communication within the nerv-
ous system. Small molecule neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles (SVs) 
and their release following SV exocytosis is responsible for the fast, point-to-point 
signaling typical of the nervous system. SVs are defined by their small size (30–50 
nm diameter), as well as their homogeneous morphology and their accumulation 
within the presynaptic nerve terminal. SVs have a defined and unique protein com-
position that allows them to package and store neurotransmitter and undergo rapid, 
Ca2+-dependent fusion with the presynaptic plasma membrane. In fact, the protein 
components of SVs are present in defined stoichiometric ratios that must be main-
tained for normal function (153). 
 
During exocytosis, SVs are thought to collapse into the plasma membrane of the 
presynaptic nerve terminal during neurotransmitter release (49, 59). There is also 
evidence for incomplete, transient fusion of the two membranes, which has been 
termed “kiss and run” fusion (52). Because presynaptic nerve terminals are located 
far away from the biosynthetic machinery in the cell body, and most nerve terminals 
have limited numbers of SVs, local mechanisms within the nerve terminal must 
reform SVs from the plasma membrane. Thus, SV exocytosis is followed by endocy-
tosis.

2 Models of SV Fate 
2.1 Maintenance of SV Integrity in the Plasma Membrane 
Following exocytosis SVs may maintain their unique character within the presynap-
tic plasma membrane (Fig. 1, left). In support of this notion, Willig et al. (174) used 
STED (stimulated emission depletion) microscopy to follow the fate of synaptotag-
min I, an integral protein of the SV membrane. STED microscopy reduces the focal 
spot of a light microscope to an order of magnitude below the diffraction limit, 
thereby allowing the analysis of individual SVs. Intriguingly, synaptotagmin I re-
mained clustered in isolated patches on the plasma membrane whether SV fusion 
was triggered by mild or intense stimulation, suggesting that SVs maintain their 
integrity in the plasma membrane (174). A recent proteomic and lipidomic analysis 
of purified SVs revealed an extremely high protein packing density such that trans-
membrane helicies may occupy more than a quarter of the entire SV membrane vol-
ume (153). Because lateral diffusion of proteins within the plasma membrane is 
decreased at high protein density (43), it is possible that SVs could retain their iden-
tity as a lipid and protein microdomain that does not diffuse laterally in the plasma 
membrane. Moreover, clustering of SV proteins within the presynaptic membrane 
could be aided by cholesterol, which represents approximately 40% of the total lipid 
content of SVs (103). A proteomic analysis reveals that many components of SVs 
and the endocytic machinery are enriched in cholesterol-rich domains of synaptic 
membranes (71). The integrity of the SV microdomain need only be maintained for a 
few seconds before the endocytic machinery could form a clathrin coat to stabilize 
the cargo for CME. Maintaining the integrity of SVs within the plasma membrane  
 
clathrin (4, 8, 49, 58). Such clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) at the synapse can 
be viewed as a specialized form of the “house-keeping” process that mediates inter-
nalization of receptors and other protein and lipid cargo in all cell types (115).  
 
It is widely thought that the major endocytic mechanism for retrieval of SV pro-
teins and the recycling of functional SVs following exocytosis is based on the protein 
 
 
The main purpose of this chapter is to review the molecular mechanisms involved 
in CME of SVs. However, to understand the task faced by this synaptic endocytic 
machinery, it is first important to understand the fate of SV membranes and mem-
brane proteins once they are transiently incorporated in the plasma membrane. At 
least three different scenarios are possible (Fig. 1): SV membranes and membrane 
proteins retain their unique identity within the plasma membrane; SV proteins dif-
fuse but are captured by an endocytic scaffold that is organized around the active 
zone, the site of SV fusion; SV proteins diffuse broadly throughout the plasma mem-
brane. We will discuss each model in turn."

active zone. Each SV is modeled as having four distinct protein components and only one SV 
undergoes exocytosis. In the first model (left panel), the SV membrane (black bar) and SV 
proteins maintain their integrity in the plasma membrane following exocytosis. A clathrin 
lattice is then built on the patch of SV membrane. In the second model (middle panel), SV 
proteins diffuse locally upon fusion of the SV with the plasma membrane but are captured by 
the endocytic machinery organized in an endocytic active zone (indicated by crossed lines) 
surrounding the exocytic active zone. A clathrin coat assembles on the membrane and sorts the 
SV proteins into a CCP. In the third model (right panel), SV proteins diffuse broadly upon SV 
fusion and intermix with populations of SV proteins already present in the plasma membrane.

would greatly simplify the task of reformation of SVs as the endocytic machinery, in 
theory, would need to target only one key protein in order to selectively retrieve all 
SV components. 
2.2 Diffusion with Capture in an Endocytic Active Zone 
A second model proposes that SV proteins diffuse within the plasma membrane 
following SV exocytosis, but are then captured in an endocytic active zone that sur-
rounds the exocytic active zone (Fig. 1, center). One candidate scaffold protein for 
the organization of such a functional endocytic microdomain is dynamin-associated 
protein of 160 kDa (Dap160) (139). Dap160 is the Drosophila homologue of inter-
sectin-short (intersectin-s), an endocytic protein of mammalian cells composed of 
two Eps15 homology (EH) domains, a coiled-coil region, and five tandem Src ho-
mology 3 (SH3) domains (176). Intersectin-s localizes to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) 
and interacts with numerous components of the machinery for CME including the 
lipid phosphatase synaptojanin and the GTPase dynamin (63). In the neuromuscular 
synapse of Drosophila, Dap160/intersectin-s is concentrated in a peri-active zone 
region, which is also enriched in the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) (47). As described 
below, AP-2 is a central factor in the nucleation of clathrin coats and the organiza-
tion of the endocytic machinery. In Drosophila, loss-of-function mutants for Dap-
160/intersectin-s have impaired SV endocytosis and are unable to sustain high-
frequency neurotransmitter release (81, 94). Further, essential endocytic proteins are 
lost from the synapse in Dap-160 null Drosophila. Thus, the organization of the 
endocytic machinery around the active zone may provide a barrier to diffusion of SV 
proteins, such that the proteins would incorporate into nascent, perhaps preformed, 
CCPs followed by CME and SV reformation. 
2.3 Broad Diffusion in the Plasma Membrane 
An alternative model regarding the fate of SV proteins is that they diffuse broadly 
within the plasma membrane following exocytosis (Fig. 1, right). This would create 
the challenge of sorting and retrieving a large number of proteins at low concentra-
tions. One possible mechanism to partially overcome this difficulty has been recently 
reported (39, 172). Using antibodies against the luminal domain of synaptotagmin I 
or tagged versions of synaptotagmin I and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 
(VAMP-2; also called synaptobrevin 2), it was demonstrated that significant pools of 
these integral SV proteins reside in the synaptic and axonal plasma membrane at rest 
and thus provide a reservoir of SV proteins that can be tapped during stimulation and 
CME (39, 152, 172) (Fig. 1). The surface reservoir would lessen the demands on the 
endocytic machinery by providing a high concentration of proteins for selection and 
inclusion in endocytic vesicles."

3 Clathrin and Endocytosis of Synaptic Vesicles 
3.1 Clathrin-Coated Vesicles in Synaptic Vesicle Recycling 
3.2 A Clathrin-Based Protein Network 
Over the last fifteen years there has been an explosion in the identification and func-
tional characterization of the protein components of the clathrin-based endocytic 
machinery. In fact, until as late as the early 1990s, the activities of clathrin and AP-2 
seemed sufficient to explain how cargo-laden CCVs were generated, at least in non-
neuronal systems. We now recognize that clathrin and AP-2 are only two compo-
nents of a large, complex and interconnected protein network that is necessary for 
CME. However, clathrin and AP-2 are key players as the globular ear (appendage) 
domains found at the C-terminal ends of the α- and β2-adaptin subunits of AP-2 (α-
ear and β2-ear) and the globular N-terminal domain (TD) of the clathrin-heavy chain 
(CHC) are major hubs for the organization of the machinery. The components of the 
machinery work together to nucleate new CCPs, to recruit cargo, to stimulate and 
drive membrane curvature and eventually to mediate membrane fission and CCV 
uncoating. Much of the work that has led to the identification of the protein compo-
nents of this machinery has stemmed from biochemical studies in the nervous sys-
tem. This approach has been particularly fruitful because the proteins that regulate 
SV endocytosis are expressed in brain at much higher levels than are their counter-
parts that function in housekeeping forms of CME in non-neuronal cells. There are 
currently approximately 30 proteins implicated in CME of SVs (Fig. 2). 
The endocytic machinery must select not only the appropriate proteins for inclusion 
in SVs, but it must select them at the correct molar ratios. It appears that clathrin-
coated vesicles (CCVs) are the main organelles responsible for such protein recy-
cling during endocytosis. A recent proteomic analysis of CCVs isolated from rat 
brain revealed SV proteins as the major cargo (8). In fact, 87% of the proteins from 
the CCV proteome assigned to the categories of SV and membrane trafficking were 
detected in a subsequent proteomic analysis of SVs; in sharp contrast, only 35% of 
the clathrin trafficking proteins from the CCVs were identified in SVs (8, 153). 
These data support an important role for CCVs in the recycling of SV components. 
Included in the CCV proteome were VAMP-1 and -2, which are v-SNARES and 
syntaxin 1A/B and synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25), which are 
t-SNAREs. The pairing of these v- and t-SNAREs is crucial for SV exocytosis. The 
relative levels of the SNARE proteins were determined by quantitative peptide 
counting (8) revealing that their molar ratios were the same as previously reported 
for SVs (168). This suggests that CCVs directly recycle SVs without sorting out 
plasma membrane-derived t-SNAREs and other proteins via endosomes, consistent 
with physiological studies in neurons (49, 114). Thus, CCVs are critical players in 
SV endocytosis. In this chapter, we will provide a detailed description of the endo-
cytic clathrin machinery of the presynaptic terminal and describe the role of this 
machinery in SV recycling."

As identification and characterization of the protein components of the synaptic 
endocytic machinery have proceeded, several general lessons regarding CME have 
emerged. One is that the endocytic protein network is highly interconnected. In gen-
eral, the proteins contain one or more of a variety of independently folded protein 
modules and additional, loosely structured or unstructured regions that may be re-
ferred to as peptide motif domains (Figs. 2 and 3). Examples of protein modules 
found in endocytic proteins include; PH (pleckstrin homology), PTB (protein tyro-
sine phosphate binding), SH3 (src homology 3), DNAJ, EH (Eps15 homology), 
E/ANTH (epsin/AP180 N-terminal homology), BAR (Bin1/amphiphysin/Rvs167), 
N-BAR and F-BAR, DENN (differentially expressed in normal versus neoplastic 
cells) and THATCH (talin-HIP1/R-Actin-Tethering C-terminal Homology) domains. 
Several of these domains mediate interactions with other proteins in the endocytic 
machinery through short, consensus peptide motifs found in the peptide motif do-
mains (Fig. 3). These interactions are generally of low affinity. However, as the 
networks form, interconnections between the various components stabilize the over-
all network in a Velcro-like arrangement. 
 
Fig. 3. Schematic presentation of protein modules involved in SV endocytosis and their bind-
ing partners. Phospholipids are depicted in black, lipid-binding modules are dark grey, and 
protein-binding modules are light grey. Protein binding partners and peptide motifs targeted 
by the domains are indicated for the specific modules. 
 
Several of these protein modules interact with phospholipids. Most notable in this 
regard is phosphatidylinositol(4,5)P2 [PtdIns(4,5)P2], a key lipid in CME that is gen-
erated primarily on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. The interaction of the 
modules with phospholipids, which are of low affinity, help to anchor the protein 
network to membranes. This arrangement of multiple sites of low affinity contacts is 
ideally suited to the biology of CCVs in that the machinery needs to assemble"

rapidly to ensure vesicle formation, but it also needs to dissociate rapidly to ensure 
subsequent SV recycling. The specific sites of low affinity are readily subject to 
regulation by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins and lipids. 
 
In addition to the formation of endocytic networks, the protein modules have 
other roles. For example, they bind to cargo and thus function in cargo recruitment to 
nascent CCPs. They interact with components of the cytoskeleton, notably actin 
linking CME to actin function. They also interact with signaling molecules allowing 
for the formation of signaling pathways on endocytic vesicles. Finally, the modules 
can directly modify membranes, critical to the formation of membrane curvature and 
vesicle formation. 
4 Mechanisms of Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis  
The rest of this chapter describes the various components of the endocytic machinery 
with a focus on those involved in CME in presynaptic terminals. We will define what 
is currently known regarding their function and how these components integrate to 
form the overall endocytic machinery. Our discussion will be organized according to 
the postulated temporal sequence of the events involved in CME. 
4.1 Nucleation of Clathrin-Coated Pits: Roles of Clathrin,  
AP-2 and AP180 
The assembly unit of the clathrin coat is the triskelion, composed of three copies of 
CHC linked through a C-terminal trimerization domain (12) (Fig. 4). Clathrin light 
chains (CLCs) are associated with CHCs but their function is poorly understood. 
CHCs radiate from the trimerization domain with a characteristic curl such that the 
protein is divided into segments, the proximal leg, the knee, the distal leg and the 
ankle, ending in the globular TD (Fig. 4). As triskelia assemble into a clathrin coat or 
cage, the proximal leg segments interdigitate through numerous weak contacts to 
form a lattice of open hexagonal and pentagonal faces with a trimerization domain at 
each vertex (167). The inherent curvature of the CHC and thus, the triskelion means 
that when assembled, clathrin takes the form of a cage or basket. Electron cryomi-
croscopy of purified clathrin cages reveals that in the assembled coat, the C-terminal 
ends of the CHCs at the trimerization domain project inward (towards the mem-
brane) and make contacts with the ankle regions of three additional triskelia, each 
centered two vertices away (42). These contacts appear to be invariant and likely 
provide stability to the lattice. 
 
Clathrin triskelia do not bind directly to membranes. Thus, other proteins are 
needed to recruit clathrin and to mediate its membrane association and in fact nu 
merous proteins, collectively known as adaptors or clathrin-associated proteins have 
been identified that fulfill this role (161). These adaptors bind to both CHCs and 
phospholipids. In the case of SV endocytosis, a key clathrin adaptor is AP180 (Fig. 2), 
which was originally identified as a component of CCVs (1) and is enriched in pre-
synaptic nerve terminals (179, 184). At its N-terminus, AP180 contains a globular"

ANTH domain that binds to PtdIns(4,5)P2 (40). Through its weakly structured C-
terminal peptide motif domain (74), AP180 binds to the TD of the CHC (110) and 
purified AP180 is sufficient in vitro to recruit CHC to PtdIns(4,5)P2-enriched lipid 
tubules (40). In addition, AP180 stimulates clathrin assembly and inhibition of the 
assembly activity in squid giant presynaptic nerve terminals disrupts formation of 
CCPs and SV endocytosis (110). Mutation of the AP180 gene of Drosophila (182) 
and C. elegans (119) also results in defects in synaptic vesicle trafficking. Thus, 
AP180 is a critical clathrin adaptor for SV endocytosis. Fig. 4. Model of synaptotagmin I as cargo receptor for CME of SVs. Upon fusion of SVs with 
the plasma membrane synaptotagmin I could coordinate SV endocytosis by recruiting stonin 2 
and AP-2 through its C2 domains. The endocytic protein network is stabilized by direct inter-
action of AP-2 with PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane and by concomitant interaction of 
stonin 2 and AP-2, which also allows clathrin recruitment and assembly. The individual sub-
units of the AP-2 complex are indicated as are the modules in stonin 2. The regions of the 
CHC are indicated as is the association of the clathrin-light chain. μHD, μ2 homology domain; 
SHD, stonin homology domain; TD, terminal domain."

Another key player in SV endocytosis is AP-2 (Figs. 2 and 4). AP-2 is enriched 
in nerve terminals (13, 178) and consists of a multi-subunit complex composed of 
two large subunits, α- and β2-adaptin and two smaller subunits, μ2- and σ2-adaptin 
(136) (Figs. 2 and 4). The large N-terminal regions of α- and β2-adaptin, along with 
the μ2 and σ2 subunits form the core of the AP-2 complex. The C-terminal regions 
of α and β2 contain the globular ear domains. The ear domains are in fact bi-lobed 
structures, composed of sandwich and platform subdomains that attach to the core 
via flexible linkers (122). Given the flexible nature of the linkers, it is thought that 
the α- and β2-ears project into the cytosol to bind to accessory proteins that function 
at different stages of CCV formation, recruiting them to sites of CME. In addition, 
clathrin triskelia bind through the TD to a consensus motif, the clathrin box, found in 
the linker region of β2-adaptin and through a region outside the TD to the β2-ear, 
and simultaneous engagement of both sites is required for full binding efficiency (30, 
121, 130, 143, 159) (Fig. 4). Through CHC binding, AP-2 recruits triskelia to mem-
branes. In addition, AP-2 stimulates assembly of triskelia into clathrin cages. This 
ability to assemble clathrin into cages is enhanced by AP180, which interacts directly 
with AP-2 in a complex that cooperatively assembles clathrin (51). 
 
There is some functional evidence that AP-2 participates in SV recycling. In 
Drosophila, SV recycling is impaired in weak AP-2 mutants and is blocked in AP-2-
deficient embryos (47). However, it should be pointed out that no loss of function 
experiments have yet been performed in mammalian neurons. AP-2 knock out mice 
die very early in development, which prevents reliable assessment of SV endocytosis 
(106). 
4.2 Nucleation of Clathrin-Coated Pits: Recruitment of AP-2 to Synaptic 
Vesicle Membranes 
Because clathrin recruitment requires the joint participation of AP-2 and AP180, the 
mechanisms that allow these adaptors to associate with synaptic membranes are 
fundamental to SV recycling. It appears that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is crucial for the recruit-
ment of AP-2 and AP180 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4). In non-neuronal systems, 
transient increases in PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels on the surface may be sufficient to initiate 
CCP formation at essentially random sites (31). However, in neurons, SV endocyto-
sis must be tightly coupled to exocytosis – both in space and in time – in order to 
prevent depletion of SVs and the expansion of the synaptic plasma membrane. Thus, 
factors in addition to PtdIns(4,5)P2 are needed to initiate CCP formation at specific 
sites on the presynaptic plasma membrane and at a time that follows exocytosis.  
 
If SV proteins maintain their integrity within the plasma membrane, then a single 
SV protein could be sufficient to act as “the cargo” for AP-2 attachment, allowing 
this membrane-associated adaptor to concentrate and assemble clathrin on the SV 
membrane. Synaptotagmin I, a SV protein that serves as the Ca2+ sensor for exocyto-
sis, is a strong candidate to play this role. A model for the mechanism by which 
PtdIns(4,5)P2 and synaptotagmin may function co-operatively in nucleation of CCPs 
on SV membranes is presented in Fig. 4 and is described below. 
 
Generation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 mainly involves phosphorylation of another mem-
brane lipid, PtdIns(4)P, by the type I PtdIns(4)P kinase (PIP kinase) (Fig. 2). PIP"
443,"===== Page 13 =====

kinase type Iγ is the major PIP kinase in the synapse and knock out of this enzyme 
leads to decreased levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and synaptic defects including delayed 
CME and slowing of SV recycling (28). GTP-bound Arf6 recruits PIP kinase type Iγ 
to the synaptic plasma membrane and stimulates its kinase activity leading to the 
formation of CCPs via increased PtdIns(4,5)P2 (83). These results implicate GTP-
Arf6 as an important upstream regulator of CCP nucleation. However, the mecha-
nisms that localize Arf6 and switch it to the active, GTP-bound form during endocy-
tosis remain unknown. 
 
Given the high concentration of AP-2 in the synapse (8, 13), it is likely that this 
adaptor protein is constantly sampling the plasma membrane through kinetic action. 
Transient increases in PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels – through activation of PIP kinase type Iγ 
– would then be detected by AP-2 through the low affinity (5–10 μM) PtdIns(4,5)P2-
binding site present in the α-adaptin subunit (62). The μ2-adaptin subunit of AP-2 
also contains a PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site, but this site is conformationally hidden 
under steady-state conditions. Subsequent to membrane interaction, μ2 undergoes a 
conformational change that exposes the second site; having two PtdIns(4,5)P2-
binding sites in a single AP-2 complex greatly stabilizes its association with the 
membrane (62). Phosphorylation of a key μ2 residue, Thr156, by the AP-2-
associated kinase (AAK1) that is associated with brain CCVs (19, 170) (Fig. 2) fa-
vors the open conformation of AP-2 (62). It is not yet known whether AAK1 activity 
has any functional role in SV endocytosis. 
 
PtdIns(4,5)P2 provides the mechanism for recruitment of AP-2/clathrin com-
plexes to membranes. A recent study in yeast provides direct evidence that 
PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels rise in conjunction with clathrin coat assembly and fall during 
disassembly (151). Moreover, in this system, PtdIns(4,5)P2 is detected in patches on 
the plasma membrane that correlate precisely with sites of endocytosis (151). How-
ever, there is little evidence that PtdIns(4,5)P2 within the presynaptic nerve terminal 
provides enough spatial information to guide clathrin cages specifically to SV mem-
branes within the plasma membrane. Instead, this role may be played by synapto-
tagmin I. The first indication that synaptotagmin functions as a cargo for endocytic 
adaptors came with the observation that it binds to AP-2 (183), suggesting that syn-
aptotagmin could mark SV membranes within the plasma membrane as the site to 
recruit clathrin coats. In fact functional studies in C. elegans, Drosophila, squid and 
hippocampal neurons have all demonstrated that synaptotagmin function is crucial 
for SV endocytosis (44, 72, 118, 126). The major binding site for synaptotagmin I 
within the AP-2 complex is the μ2 subunit (54), which is also involved in cargo 
recognition in non-neuronal cells. In fibroblasts, nascent CCPs will often collapse 
unless they incorporate cargo (31). This may occur because binding to cargo is 
needed to synergize with PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding to provide sufficient stability to keep 
AP-2 attached to the membrane. Interestingly, cargo binding to AP-2 μ2 has also 
been reported to stimulate type I PIPKs, leading to increased production of 
PtdIns(4,5)P2 (84). This could provide a positive feedback mechanism for CCP nu-
cleation. Thus, synaptotagmin interactions with μ2 may stabilize AP-2 on mem-
branes and in particular, at patches of SV membranes. 
 
Although synaptotagmin I participates in SV endocytosis, synaptotagmin does 
not undergo endocytosis when transfected into fibroblasts (69). This suggests that"

neurons possess an endocytic adaptor that functions along with synaptotagmin. 
Stonin 1 and 2 may serve this role (Figs. 2 and 4). These proteins are mammalian 
homologues of the stoned proteins of Drosophila. Stoned proteins are located at the 
synapse and are essential for the recycling of SVs through direct interactions with 
synaptotagmin (37, 125). Stonin 2 binds to synaptotagmin I through a μ2-homology 
domain (29) and also binds to the α-ear of AP-2 through a WXXF-acidic motif (134, 
135, 169), providing an additional bridge between synaptotagmin and clathrin coats. 
Thus, two individual synaptotagmin molecules (or a synaptotagmin dimer) could 
interact simultaneously with stonin 2 and with AP-2, which are bound to each other 
(Fig. 4). These interactions would provide the affinity needed for the formation of a 
stable clathrin coat on synaptotagmin-containing SV membranes. Consistent with 
this model, stonin 2/AP-2 endocytic complexes interact with synaptotagmin on the 
presynaptic plasma membrane face but not on intracellular SVs (77). However, it is 
not yet clear how the properties of synaptotagmin change when this protein resides 
on the plasma membrane. It also is not clear how these changes selectively allow 
recruitment of the endocytic coat. These and many related issues require further 
study. 
4.3 Nucleation of Clathrin-Coated Pits: NECAPs at Work with AP-2 
A proteomic analysis of highly enriched CCVs from brain revealed eight novel pro-
teins (8, 170), seven of which have been subsequently linked to clathrin-mediated 
trafficking (19, 20, 132, 134, 170, our unpublished data). Two of these proteins were 
originally recognized as homologs but that apparently shared no homology or com-
mon domains with any previously characterized proteins. The proteins, which were 
named NECAP (adaptin ear binding coat associated protein) 1 and 2, are highly 
enriched on the coats of CCVs (134). NECAP 2 is ubiquitously distributed, while 
NECAP 1 is expressed predominantly in brain. Both NECAP proteins bind to the α-
ear of AP-2 via their C-terminal regions (134) (Figs. 2 and 3). Within brain, NECAP 
1 is present in the presynaptic compartment and overexpression of constructs that 
interfere with the interaction of NECAP 1 with AP-2 blocks CME of SVs (113). 
Thus, NECAP 1 may be a new component of the SV endocytic machinery. 
 
The identification of the α-ear as a site for NECAP binding (134) was surprising: 
even though the α-ear is a key hub for organization of the endocytic machinery, 
NECAPs do not contain DPF/W or FXDXF motifs, which until recently were the 
only motifs known to bind to the α-ear (10, 120, 160). Through deletion analysis, the 
C-terminal sequence WVQF-COO– of the NECAPs was identified as a novel AP-2 
α-ear-binding motif (134). Interestingly, unlike DPF/W and FXDXF motifs, which 
bind to the platform subdomain of the α-ear, structural studies demonstrated that 
WVQF-COO– binds to the sandwich subdomain (135). Subsequent database searches 
have identified a number of endocytic proteins that contain WVQF-like motifs, in-
cluding a splice variant of synaptojanin and stonin 2, and the motifs within these 
proteins do indeed confer AP-2 binding (70, 169). Sequence alignment reveals a 
consensus motif of WXXF-acidic (where the acidic is provided by the free carboxy 
terminus or by one or more internal aspartic acid or glutamic acid residues) (135)."
445,"===== Page 15 =====
The Molecular Machinery for Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis

These results thus reveal a greater potential for the α-ear to function as a recruitment 
scaffold during CME. 
 
The exact function of NECAP 1 in SV endocytosis is unknown. However, a 
recent structural study has revealed that the conserved N-terminal region of the pro-
tein forms a PH-like domain called the PHear domain (137) (Fig. 2). Remarkably, 
this domain binds to FXDXF motifs, which as described previously are binding 
motifs for the platform subdomain of the α-ear. In fact, the PHear domain function-
ally mimics the platform subdomain of the α-ear, hence the name (PH fold with ear-
like function) (137). Thus, when NECAP is bound to the sandwich subdomain 
through the C-terminal WXXF-acidic motif, its N-terminal PHear domain would be 
positioned near the platform subdomain. Given that the α-ear is attached to the AP-2 
core via a flexible linker region, the linker apparently acts as a “fishing line” with the 
α-ear serving as the “hook” needed to snare accessory proteins from the cytosol. 
With NECAP in place, this hook would have two barbs for interacting with FXDXF 
motif-bearing proteins. Because FXDXF interactions with the α-ear platform domain 
are of low affinity, in the 50 μM range, the combination of two domains should 
increase FXDXF protein binding. In summary, NECAPs appear to function coopera-
tively with AP-2 in the formation of CCPs. 
4.4 Membrane Curvature: Eps15 and Epsin, EH and ENTH Domains 
AP-2 and AP180 are responsible for recruiting clathrin triskelia to the synaptic 
plasma membrane and for stimulating their assembly into a lattice. The inherent 
curvature of triskelia leads to a curved lattice and eventually a spherical cage as the 
triskelia are assembled. In fact, assembly of purified triskelia in vitro leads to a 
clathrin cage with a diameter similar to that of a CCV in vivo. Thus, it was long 
thought that assembly of clathrin was sufficient to drive membrane budding and 
curvature in cells and some evidence in support of this idea has been reported by 
Hinrichsen et al. (60). However, it is now thought that, under normal physiological 
conditions, clathrin assembly is not the major mechanism to drive membrane bud-
ding. Instead, it appears that various components of the clathrin machinery act di-
rectly on lipid bilayers to stimulate and maintain curvature (98). A common theme is 
that the endocytic proteins stimulate curvature by insertion of amphipathic helices 
into membranes. Inserting such helices into the cytosolic leaflet of a membrane dis-
places lipid headgroups and thereby creates an asymmetry between the bilayer leaf-
lets. Such leaflet asymmetry causes spontaneous membrane curvature toward the 
cytosolic side as predicted by the bilayer couple hypothesis (146).  
 
The first example of such a mechanism for producing membrane curvature was 
provided by studies on the ENTH domain of the endocytic protein epsin (Fig. 2). 
Epsin (Eps15-interacting protein) was originally identified because of its ability to 
bind to the EH domains of Eps15 (16). Eps15 (EGFR pathway substrate clone no. 
15) itself (Fig. 2) had been previously identified as a substrate for the EGFR kinase 
(36). Subsequent studies demonstrated that Eps15 binds to the α-ear of AP-2 (and 
the NECAP PHear domain via 15 DPF and 1 FXDXF motifs) and is a component of 
CCPs and CCVs, implicating Eps15 in CME (5, 6, 137, 158). At its N-terminus, 
Eps15 contains three copies of the EH domain (Fig. 2), which is found in other endo-"

126 
P.S. McPherson et al. 
 
cytic proteins including intersectin (109, 175). EH domains interact with a NPF 
tripeptide (Fig. 3) and epsin contains three copies of this motif (16). Both epsin and 
Eps15 are enriched in presynaptic terminals (16, 180). Disruption of interactions 
between EH domain proteins and their substrates in squid giant presynaptic nerve 
terminals inhibit the formation of CCPs and CCVs during SV endocytosis (112). 
Moreover, genetic studies have demonstrated that both the C. elegans and Droso-
phila homologues of Eps15 have crucial roles in SV recycling (92, 142). Together, 
these studies demonstrate the importance of EH domain/NPF-mediated networks for 
SV recycling (109). 
 
In addition to the NPF motifs that interact with Eps15 and intersectin, the weakly 
structured C-terminal peptide motif domain of epsin (74) also contains eight copies 
of the DPW tripeptide that mediates binding to the α-ear of AP-2 (120, 160) and two 
distinct clathrin box motifs for binding the CHC TD (63, 140) (Figs. 2 and 3). At its 
N-terminus, epsin contains an ENTH domain, an approximately 150-residue region 
(76, 140) that has a globular structure composed of eight α-helices (40, 65, 67). A 
breakthrough in the understanding of epsin function and the role of endocytic regula-
tory proteins in membrane curvature came with the observation that the ENTH do-
main binds to PtdIns(4,5)P2 through basic residues in helices 1, 3 and 4 and the loop 
between helix 1 and 2 (40, 67). More fundamentally, Ford et al. (41) demonstrated 
that binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2 causes unstructured residues at the N-terminus of the 
ENTH domain to form a new α-helix with a series of hydrophobic residues on its 
outer surface. This new helix inserts into PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing monolayers and 
this can be directly measured by assessing changes in membrane surface pressure 
(149). Interestingly, mutation of specific hydrophobic residues within the helix that 
prevented membrane insertion blocked the development of membrane curvature 
(41). Thus, epsin appears to serve a key role in the initial development of membrane 
curvature that is critical for the formation of CCPs and CCVs during SV recycling. 
 
Interestingly, mutations in epsin that disrupt the ability of the ENTH domain to 
stimulate curvature block the progression of curvature even under conditions where 
clathrin has been recruited to membranes and has assembled into a lattice (41). This 
provided a key piece of evidence that clathrin assembly on its own is unlikely to be 
sufficient for the generation of curvature. Instead, clathrin may simply form a scaf-
fold upon which the curvature machinery (ENTH domain and BAR domain proteins, 
see below) is organized. Additionally, the clathrin lattice may contribute to curvature 
by the formation of a mold into which the deformed membrane can be structured into 
a highly curved vesicle. Regardless of the precise mechanism, it has become appar-
ent that generating a highly curved SV from an essentially flat synaptic plasma 
membrane is complex and likely involves a series of proteins working in concert.  
4.5 Membrane Curvature: Endophilin and Amphiphysin, N-BAR  
and BAR Domains 
Endophilin was originally identified in biochemical and yeast two-hybrid screens as 
a binding partner for the endocytic enzyme synaptojanin (25, 133). Endophilin is 
composed of an N-terminal BAR domain, a central domain and a C-terminal SH3 
domain (Fig. 2). The SH3 domain mediates interactions with proline-rich sequences"

in the peptide motif domains of synaptojanin and dynamin (104, 133) (Fig. 3) and it 
is the ability to bind to these key endocytic regulatory enzymes that gave endophilin 
its name (104). Disruption of these interactions through injection of peptides and 
antibodies into the lamprey reticulospinal synapse impairs SV endocytosis, demon-
strating a role for endophilin in SV recycling (45). Subsequent studies in Drosophila 
and C. elegans have revealed that endophilin mutants and synaptojanin mutants have 
nearly identical phenotypes: both have accumulations of CCVs in the synapse and an 
abnormal, clustered distribution of SVs away from the active zone (144, 164). More-
over, defects observed in synaptojanin and endophilin double mutants closely resem-
ble those seen in either single mutant, demonstrating that the two proteins function 
on the same pathway (144, 164) as predicted from earlier biochemical studies (25, 
133). Finally, synaptojanin was lost from the nerve terminals of endophilin mutants 
(144, 164), thus indicating that endophilin serves to recruit synaptojanin to nerve 
terminals during SV endocytosis. There also are indications that endophilin may play 
additional roles during endocytosis (26, 165) 
 
Amphiphysin 1 and 2 are two proteins that have domain structures similar to that 
of endophilin. These proteins have an N-terminal BAR domain, a variable central 
domain and a C-terminal SH3 domain (Fig. 2). As is the case for endophilin, the SH3 
domains of the amphiphysins bind to synaptojanin and dynamin (23, 99, 129). Am-
phiphysin 1 is expressed predominantly in brain, while amphiphysin 2, which is 
expressed as alternatively spliced isoforms, is more widely distributed (14, 23, 24, 
129, 130). The predominant neuronal isoform of amphiphysin 2 forms heterodimers 
with amphiphysin 1 and this amphiphysin heterodimer is concentrated in presynaptic 
nerve terminals (129, 173). Both components of this heterodimer interact, via their 
central domain, with clathrin, NECAP and AP-2 (97, 129, 130, 137). Thus, amphi-
physins are well positioned to function in the recruitment of synaptojanin and dy-
namin to sites of CCV formation during SV endocytosis. In fact, presynaptic micro-
injection of peptides that compete with the binding partners of the SH3 domains of 
the amphiphysins impairs SV endocytosis (148). Moreover, knock out of the amphi-
physin 1 gene of mice leads to a concomitant loss of amphiphysin 2 and defects in 
SV recycling (27). Thus, the amphiphysins are key players in SV endocytosis. 
 
Most recently, much of the focus on endophilin and amphiphysin has been on the 
BAR domain. The function of BAR domains was first suggested from the observa-
tion that the N-terminus of amphiphysin I, which mediates dimerization (131, 173) 
could bind to liposomes and cause them to form tubules (155). It was subsequently 
demonstrated that the N-terminus of endophilin, which is weakly homologous to the 
N-terminus of amphiphysin, also binds to membranes and converts lipid bilayers into 
narrow tubules (35). Structural studies of the BAR domain from arfaptin (157) and 
amphiphysin (124) revealed a dimer, with each monomer composed of three kinked 
α-helices that together form a six helix bundle. The BAR domain dimer has an elon-
gated crescent structure, with positive charge along a concave surface that permits 
electrostatic interactions with negatively charged membranes (124). More recently, 
several groups have solved the structure of the BAR domain of endophilin (46, 96, 
171). The structure is very similar to that of amphiphysin, except for the presence of 
an N-terminal amphipathic helix and two largely disordered domains that are in-
serted into helix 1, projecting from the concave face of the dimer. When the BAR"

domain engages the membrane, the N-terminal helix folds and is peripherally bound 
in the plane of the membrane, ideally situated to affect membrane curvature (46, 96). 
The combination of the N-terminal helix with the BAR domain has led to the desig-
nation of the N-BAR domain. 
 
Thus, BAR domains are thought to have two distinct but overlapping functions. 
First, they can act as molecular switches. Different BAR domains can have different 
degrees of curvature on their concave faces and will thus best interact with mem-
branes of a defined degree of curvature (98). They could thus serve to recruit pro-
teins to newly formed vesicles only after a certain degree of curvature has been 
reached. For example, the amphiphysin BAR domain would best recognize a bilayer 
with curvature similar to the neck of a deeply invaginated CCP and could thus recruit 
dynamin specifically to this site. A second function for BAR domains, and in par-
ticular for N-BAR domains, is to contribute to the induction of curvature by forcing 
membranes to conform to the concave face of the module (98). In addition, insertion 
of the N-terminal helix of an N-BAR domain into the cytosolic leaflet stimulates 
curvature as descried for ENTH domains. In summary, amphiphysins and endophilin 
both recruit endocytic proteins, such as dynamin and synaptojanin, and contribute to 
curving of membranes during CCV formation. 
4.6 Transition to Fission: F-BAR Domains Link Curvature to Fission 
Via Actin 
The FCH (Fes/CIP4 homology) domain is a protein module found in a wide variety 
of proteins. Many of these proteins have been linked to regulation of the actin cy-
toskeleton while others have been implicated in CME, due to their SH3 domain-
dependent binding to dynamin (68, 162). For example, the syndapin/PACSIN family 
of proteins (Fig. 2) functions in CME via interactions with dynamin and synaptojanin 
and also contributes to regulation of actin via binding to N-WASP (108, 127). Recent 
examination of sequences downstream of the FCH domain revealed a coiled-coil 
domain that, when considered as part of the FCH domain, is homologous to BAR 
domains. The extended module was thus renamed the extended FCH (EFC) or F-
BAR domain (68, 162). Like BAR domains, the F-BAR domain tubulates lipid 
membranes both in liposomes and in cells. However, the tubules formed by F-BAR 
domains are larger in diameter than those produced by N-BAR domains (68, 162). 
Most recently, two groups have solved the crystal structure of the F-BAR domain 
(55, 147). The structures reveal a gently curving helical-bundle dimer with a distant 
relationship to BAR domains. The curved domain best fits a tubular membrane with 
a diameter of approximately 60 nm and generates tubules as large as 130 nm in di-
ameter (55, 147). The module forms filaments through end-to-end interactions, lead-
ing to striations on tubular membranes after addition of the F-BAR domain (147). 
Thus, F-BAR domains may sense initial states of curvature of CCPs and then assem-
ble into filaments around the invaginated membrane to drive further CCP invagina-
tion (147). 
 
It thus appears that the membrane curvature needed for CCV formation is gener-
ated through the coordinated action of several lipid-binding protein modules. Ini-
tially, ENTH domains and N-BAR domains insert amphipathic helicies into mem-"

branes to create bilayer asymmetry and initiate curvature. This low degree of curva-
ture of the membrane would then be sensed by F-BAR domain proteins, which 
would form filaments to further induce invagination. Once the membrane reaches a 
deeply invaginated state, BAR domain proteins would recognize the highly curved, 
small diameter membrane at the neck of the vesicle and recruit dynamin to drive 
membrane fission. In addition, many F-BAR domain proteins interact with regula-
tory proteins of the actin cytoskeleton, most notably N-WASP. Thus, as these pro-
teins drive later stages of curvature they could also recruit N-WASP to endocytic 
sites. N-WASP stimulates actin assembly, which has been proposed to apply tension 
on the invaginated membrane for the function of dynamin (141). Through formation 
of such protein networks, which initiate, stabilize and resolve membrane curvature-
dependent processes, early events and late events in the formation of CCPs and 
CCVs could be linked. 
4.7 Transition to Fission: HIPs and Intersectin-l Provide Additional 
Links to Actin 
Another link between the clathrin machinery and the actin cyoskeleton is provided 
by the huntingtin-interacting proteins (HIPs) (Fig. 2). HIP1 was initially identified in 
a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with huntingtin, the protein prod-
uct of the Huntington's disease gene (73). Another HIP1-related protein 
(HIP1R/HIP12) was identified by its sequence similarity to HIP1, although HIP1R 
does not bind directly to huntingtin (18). HIP1 and HIP1R have similar domain 
structures, with an N-terminal ANTH domain for phospholipid interaction (66), a 
helical domain that mediates dimerization and binding to CLCs, and a C-terminal 
THATCH domain (7, 11, 33, 56, 87) (Fig. 2). The interaction of HIPs with CLCs 
targets these proteins to clathrin-coated structures (17, 88), causing HIP1 and HIP1R 
to be major components of the coats of CCPs and CCVs (32, 33, 102, 105, 166). 
 
The C-terminal THATCH domain allows HIP1R (but not HIP1) to bind to actin 
(11, 33, 87). Moreover, a proline-rich sequence of HIP1R binds to the SH3 domain 
of cortactin (85). While cortactin stimulates actin assembly via activation of N-
WASP, interaction of cortactin with HIP1R inhibits actin assembly (85). Thus, 
knock down of HIP1R with small inhibitory RNA leads to over-assembly of actin 
and defects in CME (34, 85). HIP1R therefore appears to be necessary for the appro-
priate interaction of clathrin-coated structures with the actin cytoskeleton. Under 
normal physiological circumstances, HIP1R, perhaps in heterodimers with HIP1, 
could link actin to clathrin coats on deeply invaginated CCPs, providing the invagi-
nating endocytic structure with the tension that is needed for dynamin to drive mem-
brane fission (141).  
 
Another actin regulatory protein that is also involved in CME is intersectin-
long (intersectin-l). Intersectin-l, a splice variant of intersectin-s, has a C-terminal 
extension with a Dbl homology (DH), pleckstrin homology (PH) and C2 domain 
(63) (Fig. 2). The combination of DH and PH domains is characteristic of guanine-
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and allows intersectin-l to act as a Cdc42-
specific GEF (64, 75, 181). The GEF activity of intersectin-l is stimulated by N-
WASP binding to intersectin-l. This increases the amount of GTP-bound Cdc42,"

P.S. McPherson et al. 
 
which in turn activates N-WASP and stimulates actin assembly (64). In addition, 
intersectin-l binds to dynamin (176). Thus, intersectin-l is ideally situated to stimu-
late actin assembly in proximity to CCPs and CCVs, particularly in the presence of 
dynamin, although whether or not intersectin-1 functions in CME of SVs has never 
been tested.  
4.8 Fission of CCVs: Dynamin Drives Membrane Fission 
Dynamin was one of the first endocytic accessory proteins to be identified and re-
mains a central feature of all current models of endocytosis. Dynamin contains an N-
terminal GTPase domain, a GED (GTPase effector domain), which acts as an in-
tramolecular GTPase activating protein (GAP) (145), and a proline-rich domain that 
binds various SH3 domain-bearing proteins (48) (Fig. 2). A role for dynamin in 
CME was originally suggested by its identification as the product of the Drosophila 
shibire gene (163). Temperature-sensitive Shibire mutants display rapid paralysis at 
the restrictive temperature, due to impairment of SV recycling and subsequent block 
of synaptic transmission (80). This block of SV recycling at the non-permissive 
temperature is due to inhibition of membrane fission during endocytosis, evident as the 
appearance of endocytic vesicles that remain attached to the plasma membrane by 
narrow membrane stalks (82). Dynamin was subsequently demonstrated to oligomerize 
into rings with an inner diameter similar to that of the membrane stalks seen in shibire 
flies (61). Treatment of synaptosomes with GTPγS, which locks dynamin into a GTP-
bound state and inhibits SV endocytosis (57, 177), leads to production of CCVs that 
remained attached to the plasma membrane via extended membrane necks (154). The 
necks are coated with dynamin spirals, leading to the hypothesis that dynamin func-
tions in vesicle fission as a mechanochemical enzyme that utilizes GTP hydrolysis to 
provide a twisting force that severs the membrane tube (154). 
 
Various models have been proposed to explain how dynamin functions in vesicle 
fission. In the GTP-bound form, dynamin appears as tightly packed rings on lipid 
nanotubes, with GTP hydrolysis increasing the space between the rings. This sug-
gests that a spring-like expansion (conformational change) drives vesicle fission 
(150). The main alternative model is that dynamin does not function as a mechano-
chemical enzyme but – by analogy to other GTPases – functions in the recruitment 
of other factors required for fission (145). This model arose from the study of dy-
namin with mutations in the GED domain that inhibited the intramolecular GAP 
activity and thus held dynamin in the active, GTP-bound state. These mutants in fact 
stimulated CME, suggesting that GTP-bound dynamin recruits other (unidentified) 
proteins that produce fission (145). Thus, the exact mechanism of dynamin function 
has remained elusive.  
 
A recent paper has provided support for the role of dynamin as a mechanochemi-
cal enzyme that drives fission (141). Specifically, the addition of GTP to dynamin-
coated lipid tubules resulted in twisting of the tubules: this twisting motion was ob-
served by using streptavidin beads conjugated to biotinylated dynamin, in which the 
beads were seen to swing around the tubules. Moreover, when lipid tubules were 
generated by the motor activity of kinesin on microtubules, and were thus subjected 
to longtitudinal tension, dynamin/GTP could drive fission, while no fission was"

131
 
 
 
observed in the absence of tension (141). Thus, the twisting force of dynamin ap-
pears to lead to constriction that causes fission on membranes under tension. In cells, 
it is likely that tension on the deeply invaginated CCPs is provided by the assembly 
of actin. 
 
Work with the shibire mutant of Drosophila leaves no doubt that dynamin plays 
a crucial role in SV endocytosis. The function of dynamin in SV endocytosis in 
mammalian presynaptic terminals was recently clarified through the use of dynamin 
1 knock out mice (38). Mammals express three dynamin genes: dynamin 1, which is 
brain specific and is the most abundant form, dynamin 2 that is expressed ubiqui-
tously, and dynamin 3, which is expressed in brain and testis (15). In dynamin 1 null 
animals, SV endocytosis is highly compromised during strong exogenous stimula-
tion. Somewhat surprisingly however, SV endocytosis is normal after strong stimula-
tion stops (38). Expressing any of the three dynamin isoforms in knock-out neurons 
could compensate for the dynamin 1 phenotype, though dynamin 3 was more effec-
tive than dynamin 2. Thus, whereas dynamin 1 functions during high levels of neu-
ronal activity, other mechanisms drive membrane fission during low levels of activ-
ity, with dynamin 3 being the most likely candidate for the fission that does not 
depend upon dynamin 1. 
 
The proline-rich peptide motif domain of dynamin 1 has multiple sites for SH3 
domain binding (Fig. 2), with endophilin, amphiphysin and syndapin/PACSIN 
being the three key interacting proteins. Each of these proteins contains an N-
terminal domain that can sense membrane curvature: endophilin (N-BAR domain), 
amphiphysin (BAR domain) and syndapin (F-BAR domain). Interestingly, the 
degree of curvature that is best suited for each domain is unique (55, 124, 147). 
Thus, it is possible that these proteins contribute to the recruitment of dynamin 1 to 
the membrane at different stages of CCV formation. Although it is clear that dy-
namin functions late in CME, this protein also appears to function at earlier steps 
(91). For example, the F-BAR domain appears to best fit membrane curvatures 
consistent with a shallow CCP whereas the amphiphysin BAR domain recognizes 
highly curved membranes such as those at the neck of a deeply invaginated CCP 
(55, 124, 147).  
 
Interestingly, the ability of dynamin 1 to interact with its SH3 domain partners is 
regulated by phosphorylation. In fact, dynamin 1 is one of a group of at least eight 
dephosphins, proteins that undergo a coordinated dephosphorylation reaction in 
nerve terminals during SV endocytosis (21). It is thought that the dephosphorylation 
promotes the assembly of protein complexes needed for SV endocytosis. The subse-
quent rephosphorylation of the proteins is necessary for maintaining the continuity of 
SV recycling (21). To date, only one dephosphin kinase has been identified, cyclin-
dependent protein kinase 5 (Cdk5); disruption of its activity blocks CME of SVs 
(156). Careful analysis of the phosphorylation of dynamin 1 by Cdk5 has revealed 
that the major phosphorylation-regulated dynamin 1 partner is syndapin (3). Thus, 
although the functional role of the dynamin 1/syndapin interaction is unknown, it 
appears clear that these proteins form a highly regulated partnership that is critical 
for SV endocytosis and recycling."

4.9 Uncoating CCVs: Synaptojanin and Stability of Coats 
Once CCVs have been liberated from the membrane by dynamin-dependent fission, 
they must rapidly uncoat before they can be reloaded with neurotransmitter and re-
enter the recycling pool of SVs. At least two types of proteins have been implicated 
in this process, synaptojanin and the uncoating ATPase Hsc70. 
 
Synaptojanin was originally identified as a 145 kDa protein that bound to SH3 
domains, was expressed predominantly in brain, and was enriched on endocytic 
intermediates of the synapse (99, 100). Subsequent cloning of the protein, which was 
later renamed synaptojanin 1-145, revealed a N-terminal Sac1 homology domain 
followed by a central inositol 5-phosphatase domain and a proline-rich C-terminus 
(101) (Fig. 2). The Sac1 domain dephosphorylates PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(4)P and the 
5-phosphatase domain dephosphorylates PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at the 5′ 
position (50, 101). The identification of synaptojanin 1-145 was in fact instrumental 
in the early development of the idea that PtdIns(4,5)P2 functions in SV endocytosis. 
The C-terminal peptide motif domain of synaptojanin 1-145 is primarily a protein 
interaction domain that binds to a variety of SH3 domain-containing proteins that are 
thought to be involved in targeting the protein to sites of CME. Through an alterna-
tive splice in the C-terminus, a second, longer synaptojanin 1 isoform, synaptojanin 
1-170, is generated. This isoform is expressed in brain but has a much broader tissue 
distribution than synaptojanin 1-145 (128). Synaptojanin 1-170 contains additional 
peptide motifs for binding to clathrin, AP-2 and EH domains (Figs. 2 and 3). Inter-
estingly, multicolor TIRF (total internal reflection fluorescence) microscopy has 
recently revealed that synaptojanin 1-145 is recruited to membranes as a burst at a 
late stage of CCP formation, whereas synaptojanin 1-170 is present at CCPs 
throughout their formation (123). Thus, dynamic phosphoinositide metabolism is 
likely to be important at all stages of CCP/CCV formation. 
 
In neurons, synaptojanin 1 knock-out mice have increased overall levels of 
PtdIns(4,5)P2 and an accumulation of uncoated CCVs in their presynaptic terminals 
(22). Moreover, mutations in unc-26, the C. elegans homologue of synaptojanin, also 
lead to defects in the budding of SVs from the plasma membrane and in the uncoat-
ing of CCVs (53). Thus, synaptojanin-dependent dephosphorylation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 
is likely important as a trigger to destabilize clathrin coats following SV endocytosis, 
allowing the coat to come off and the SV to re-enter the release pool. In yeast, 
patches of PtdIns(4,5)P2 that form on the plasma membrane are rapidly lost co-
incident with the arrival of synaptojanin and disassembly of the clathrin coat (151). 
Indeed, synaptojanin knock-out mice show a delay in the reentry of recycling vesi-
cles into the fusion-competent pool although SV recycling is not abolished (78). A 
second gene product, synaptojanin 2, has also been identified and at least one synap-
tojanin 2 splice variant is expressed in nerve terminals (116). The function of synap-
tojanin 2 in SV endocytosis has not been directly assessed but it is possible that it is 
functionally redundant with synaptojanin 1 and accounts for the residual SV endocy-
tosis seen in synaptojanin 1 null animals."

4.10 Uncoating CCVs: Auxilin and Hsc70 
While dephosphorylation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 contributes to destabilization of the coat of 
CCVs, it is not sufficient to disassemble the clathrin lattice. In vitro, the assembly of 
clathrin triskelia into clathrin cages can proceed spontaneously, indicating that an 
energy-dependent step is necessary to dissociate the clathrin cage. The energy re-
quired for disassembly of clathrin cages appears to come from an ATPase, the heat 
shock cognate 70 (Hsc70) protein. Hsc70 is a critical factor in CCV uncoating in 
vitro, with the hydrolysis of three ATP molecules necessary for the release of one 
triskelia (9, 79) and dominant-negative forms of Hsc70 disrupt clathrin uncoating 
and multiple stages of clathrin-mediated trafficking in cells (117). Essential co-
factors for Hsc70 are the auxilins. Auxilin 1, which is brain specific, contains an N-
terminal region with sequence similarity to the phosphatase and C2 domains of 
PTEN (a PtdIns(3)-phosphatase), a central region containing motifs that bind to 
clathrin and AP-2, and a DNAJ domain at the C-terminus (Fig. 2). Auxilin 2, which 
is also known as cyclin G-associated kinase or GAK, has a ubiquitous tissue distribu-
tion and a similar domain structure as auxilin 1 but with an additional N-terminal 
ser/thr kinase domain (79). Auxilins bind directly to clathrin and AP-2 and through 
the DNAJ domain they bind Hsc70 in the ATP-bound form. Injection into presynap-
tic nerve terminals of auxilin 1 with a mutation in the conserved HPD motif of the 
DNAJ domain, which prevents auxilin 1 interaction with Hsc70, disrupts CCV un-
coating and synaptic transmission (111). Thus, a key function for auxilin is to recruit 
Hsc70 to newly formed CCVs for uncoating and SV recycling. 
 
Because auxilins should be able to bind to partially assembled lattices, it is im-
portant to understand what prevents Hsc70 from uncoating CCVs prematurely. One 
potential mechanism is that auxilin may be recruited to CCVs only late in their life 
cycle. Alternatively, Hsc70 could be recruited at any time but with the ATPase activ-
ity regulated to only activate uncoating at specific times. Two recent studies have 
examined the recruitment of auxilin over the life cycle of CCVs in non-neuronal 
systems (86, 95). Auxilin was found to be present at sites of CCV formation at early 
points, however, there is a major burst of auxilin recruitment following the peak of 
dynamin recruitment late in the CCV life cycle. Interestingly, the late recruitment of 
auxilin depends upon the PTEN-like domain. This domain binds specifically to 
inostiol phospholipids, most notably to PtdIns(3)P (86, 95). This result suggests that 
a switch in the levels of specific inositol phospholipid levels late in CCV formation 
may act as a trigger to recruit auxilin/Hsc70 for CCV uncoating. This is perhaps not 
surprising given the key role of inositol phospholipids in the nucleation of CCPs and 
the observation that knock out of synaptojanin leads to an accumulation of CCVs in 
nerve terminals (22). 
 
Hsc70 has recently been identified as a binding partner of CHL1, a cell adhesion 
molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily (89). Ablation of the CHL1 gene re-
duced the levels of Hsc70 in the presynaptic compartment and CHL1 deficiency or 
disruption of CHL1/Hsc70 interactions led to the accumulation of CCVs at synapses 
(89). Thus, CHL1 appears to function as a synapse-targeting factor for Hsc70. How-
ever, CHL1 was also found to undergo CME in an activity dependent manner and to 
interact with Hsc70 on CCVs in the synapse. Thus, CHL1 may represent an addi-"

tional mechanism to recruit Hsc70 for CCV uncoating during SV recycling, which 
may be needed to meet the high demands placed on this specialized form of CME. 
4.11 Post-Uncoating: Connecdenn and DENN Domains, a Late Function 
in Endocytosis? 
Identification of the consensus WXXF-acidic α-ear-binding motif in the NECAP 
proteins led to a bioinformatics analysis that revealed a novel protein containing the 
C-terminal sequence WETFE-COO– (2). At its N-terminus, the protein contains a 
module referred to as the DENN (differentially expressed in normal versus neoplas-
tic cells) domain, leading to the name connecdenn for this protein (2) (Fig. 2). Con-
necdenn is highly enriched on CCVs and, as expected, binds to the α-ear of AP-2. 
The protein is expressed predominantly in brain where it is enriched in presynaptic 
nerve terminals (2). In addition to the WXXF-acidic motif, connecdenn also contains 
single DPF and FXDXF motifs; all three of these motifs contribute to α-ear binding, 
although the WXXF-acidic motif is the strongest of the three. Disruption of the in-
teraction of connecdenn with AP-2, through overexpression of C-terminal con-
necdenn fragments, blocks SV endocytosis in hippocampal neurons, as does con-
necdenn knock down using lentiviral delivery of connecdenn-specific shRNA (2). 
These experiments suggest that connecdenn is a component of the machinery for SV 
endocytosis.  
 
DENN domains are composed of upstream (u)DENN and downstream (d)DENN 
modules flanking a DENN module, forming a unit that is readily detected using the 
conserved domain search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (93). 
The domain is well conserved throughout evolution and is found in multiple proteins 
from diverse species including humans, C. elegans and S. pombe. Prominent DENN 
domain-containing proteins include myotubular myopathy related (MTMR) 5 and 
13, which are homologues of the myotubularin lipid phosphatases that function at 
endosomes (138) and DENN/MADD, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for the 
SV protein Rab3 (107). However, the majority of DENN domain-containing proteins 
are uncharacterized and there is essentially no information regarding DENN domain 
structure or the biological context of DENN domain function (90). Connecdenn is 
thus important because it links DENN domain proteins to the process of SV endocy-
tosis and introduces a new module into the endocytic machinery (Fig. 3). 
 
Connecdenn has a unique association with CCVs in that it remains associated 
with the vesicles following CCV uncoating (2). In fact, the protein is tightly associ-
ated with the membranes and resists extraction even in the presence of high salt (2). 
Preliminary evidence demonstrates that the C-terminus of connecdenn guides the 
protein to CCVs but the DENN domain is responsible for the stable membrane asso-
ciation. It is likely that the stable association of connecdenn with CCV membranes 
ensures a post-uncoating function for the protein, likely in endosomal trafficking or 
morphology. Interestingly, knock-out of DENN/MADD leads to mice that have 
reduced numbers of SVs, suggesting a possible defect in SV reformation (107). 
Thus, DENN domain proteins may be involved generally in endocytic membrane 
trafficking and SV endocytosis/reformation."

5 Conclusions 
Although it has been known for more than 30 years that endocytosis via CCVs is 
required for SV recycling, for most of these years our understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms involved in SV endocytosis has lagged far behind our appreciation of 
the molecular mechanisms of SV exocytosis. Fortunately, a surge in studies of CCVs 
and their molecular constituents has led to tremendous recent advances in our appre-
ciation of the molecular underpinnings of SV endocytosis. One tangible result is that 
nearly 30 proteins now have been implicated in SV endocytosis (Fig. 2), though 
more endocytic proteins undoubtedly await discovery. 
 
To date, the main conclusion is that the sequence of events that leads to removal 
of SV components from the plasma membrane and the recycling of SVs requires a 
complex web of interactions between proteins and lipids. This web is based on the 
interaction domains that are depicted in Fig. 3. This web of interactions must be 
regulated, both in time and in space, to yield a vectorial progression of CCVs 
through many molecular states. 
 
The actual sequence of molecular events involved in endocytosis is not yet clear. 
Thus far, multiple proteins and protein-protein interactions have been implicated in 
each of the many partial reactions involved in endocytic retrieval of SVs. While the 
information presented in Section 4 can be assembled into a rudimentary model of SV 
endocytosis, further experimental work will be needed to turn these preliminary 
hypotheses into conclusive definitions of functional roles. An important step toward 
this goal will be to define the precise times at which each of these interactions occurs 
during SV endocytosis. Such work eventually will lead to a comprehensive and 
quantitative description of protein and lipid dynamics involved in SV endoytosis.

1 Introduction 
2 Calcium Currents in Excitable Cells 
Ionic currents conducted by Ca2+ in different cell types have diverse physiological 
roles and pharmacological properties, and an alphabetical nomenclature has evolved 
for the distinct classes of Ca2+ currents (80). L-type Ca2+ currents typically require a 
strong depolarization for activation, have slow voltage-dependent inactivation, and 
are blocked by the organic L-type Ca2+ channel antagonists, including 
dihydropyridines, phenylalkylamines, and benzothiazepines (79). In muscle and 
endocrine cells, L-type currents initate contraction and secretion, respectively.

Ca2+ entry through presynaptic voltage-gated Ca2+ (Cav) channels initiates release of 
neurotransmitters. Multiple mechanisms directly or indirectly modulate the function 
of these presynaptic Ca2+ channels and thereby regulate synaptic transmission (66, 
17, 7). Ca2+ channels that have been characterized biochemically are complexes of a 
pore-forming α1 subunit of approximately 250 kDa with auxiliary β, α2δ, and γ 
subunits (77, 7, 18). Ten α1 subunits are known in vertebrates, which fall into three 
structurally and functionally distinct subfamilies (18). The CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 
channels are the primary Ca2+ entry pathways at conventional fast synapses, whereas 
ribbon synapses in specialized sensory cells have CaV1.3 or CaV1.4 channels (17, 7, 
51). Neuromodulators affect the ability of Cav channels to open, close, or inactivate 
in response to membrane depolarization, and alter the response of these channels to 
repetitive stimuli (7). This chapter reviews the structure and function of presynaptic 
Ca2+ channels and the progress toward characterization of the cellular and molecular 
mechanisms that modulate their activity and regulate synaptic transmission.

segments is a component of skeletal muscle Ca2+ channels, and related subunits are 
expressed in heart and brain. The auxiliary subunits of Ca2+ channels have an 
important influence on their function (28, 16). CaVβ subunits greatly enhance cell 
surface expression of α1 subunits and shift their kinetics and voltage dependence of 
activation and inactivation. Most CaVβ subunits accelerate activation and voltage-
dependent inactivation and shift the voltage dependence of gating to more negative 
membrane potentials, but the CaVβ2a subunit has the opposite effect in most cases. 
The α2δ subunits also enhance cell surface expression of α1 subunits, but have 
smaller and less consistent effects on the kinetics and voltage dependence of gating 
(13). The γ subunits do not increase cell surface expression of CaV channels, and in 
some cases reduce it substantially. The functional role of these subunits of Ca2+ 
channels is the least well-defined. Although these four auxiliary subunits modulate 
the functional properties of the Ca2+ channel complex, the pharmacological and 
physiological diversity of Ca2+ channels arises primarily from the existence of 
multiple α1 subunits. 
4 Physiological Roles of Calcium Channels in Neurons 
Ca2+ channels convert depolarization of the cell surface membrane during the action 
potential into a transient, local increase in intracellular Ca2+, which serves as a 
second messenger to initiate many physiological events. In neurons, three of the key 
physiological events initiated by Ca2+ channels are synaptic integration, synaptic 
transmission, and gene regulation. All three subfamilies of Ca2+ channels participate 
in Ca2+ signaling in dendrites and cell bodies and in integration of synaptic signals. 
In contrast, CaV1 and CaV2 channels are specialized for synaptic transmission at 
ribbon synapses and fast conventional synapses, respectively (66, 17, 55, 7, 51). Ca2+ 
entering neurons through CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 channels is primarily responsible for 
initiating synaptic transmission at fast conventional synapses in the peripheral and 
central nervous systems (17, 47). CaV2.2 channels, which conduct N-type Ca2+ 
current, are most important at synapses formed by neurons of the peripheral nervous 
system. In contrast, CaV2.1 channels, which conduct P/Q-type Ca2+ currents, play the 
major role at most synapses formed by neurons of the mammalian central nervous 
system. Both CaV2.2 channels and CaV2.3 channels also have a significant role in 
initiating transmitter release at central synapses. In some neurons, including a subset 
Ca2+ channel α1 subunits are encoded by ten distinct genes in mammals (66, 7, 
18). The CaV1 subfamily of channels (CaV1.1 to CaV1.4) conduct L-type Ca2+ 
currents. The CaV2 subfamily members (CaV2.1 to CaV2.3) conduct P/Q-type, N-
type, and R-type Ca2+ currents, respectively. The CaV3 subfamily members 
(CaV3.1 to CaV3.3) conduct T-type Ca2+ currents. The amino acid sequences of 
these α1 subunits are more than 70% identical within a subfamily but less than 
40% identical among the three subfamilies. Division of Ca2+ channels into these 
three subfamilies is phylogenetically ancient, as single representatives of each are 
found in the C. elegans genome. Evidently, the molecular properties of these three 
different channel families enable them to participate in distinct physiological 
pathways."

of inhibitory interneurons of the hippocampus (55), CaV2.2 channels are predominant 
in neurotransmitter release at central synapses. On the other hand, CaV2.3 channels 
seem always to play a secondary role at central synapses compared to CaV2.1 and/or 
CaV2.2 channels. The molecular basis for the prominent role of CaV2 channels in 
neurotransmission is not completely understood, but one factor is their direct 
interactions with the neurotransmitter release machinery in Ca2+ channel signaling 
complexes. 
5 Calcium Channel Signaling Complexes 
Ca2+ entering neurons through Ca2+ channels forms a transient microdomain of 
high Ca2+ concentration in the presynaptic nerve terminal (44, 65, 71). Intracellular 
proteins that must bind Ca2+ to initiate or regulate essential physiological processes 
must be located near Ca2+ channels in order to receive the Ca2+ signal. In many 
cases, this close localization is achieved by direct interaction with the intracellular 
domains of Ca2+ channels, which serve as signal transduction platforms for 
cytosolic Ca2+ signaling (7). Similarly, proteins that regulate Ca2+ channels in 
response to second messenger signaling are also often directly associated with Ca2+ 
channels (7). The signaling complexes of presynaptic Ca2+ channels include 
interactions with the SNARE proteins involved in exocytosis and many Ca2+-
binding proteins involved in regulation of channel activity and initiation of Ca2+-
dependent responses. 
6 Presynaptic Calcium Channels and SNARE Proteins 
6.1 Tight Spatial Co-Localization of Presynaptic Ca2+ Channels and the 
Synaptic Vesicle Release Machinery  
Synaptic transmission relies on local Ca2+ transients generated near the mouth of 
presynaptic Ca2+ channels, and even Ca2+ entry through a single Ca2+ channel can 
trigger vesicular release (70). Ca2+-triggered synaptic vesicle exocytosis depends on 
the assembly of the SNARE complex, the basic fusion machinery, in which the 
vesicle-associated v-SNARE protein synaptobrevin (VAMP) interacts with two 
plasma membrane-associated t-SNARE proteins, SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1 (67, 1, 
75). Maturation into a release-ready synaptic vesicle requires synaptotagmin, an 
integral Ca2+-binding protein of the synaptic vesicle membrane that provides the 
Ca2+-dependent regulation of the fusion machinery. Ca2+ influx into the presynaptic 
terminal triggers the Ca2+ sensor of the fusion machinery, upon which the SNARE 
complex binding progresses from a trans- to a cis-state, resulting in the fusion of 
apposing membranes and the release of neurotransmitter. 
Neurotransmitter release is initiated within 200 µs after the arrival of the action 
potential and critically depends on Ca2+ influx through high-voltage-activated Ca2+ 
channels. Exocytosis of synaptic vesicles requires high Ca2+ concentration, with a"

threshold of 10–50 μM and near maximal activation at 200 μM (59). Given that the 
intracellular Ca2+ concentration falls off steeply as a function of the distance away 
from the Ca2+ channels, the brief rise in the Ca2+ concentration to the level 
necessary for exocytosis is thought to occur only in close proximity to the 
presynaptic Ca2+ channels (44) (Fig. 2). Thus, the tightly localized rise in 
intracellular Ca2+ and the subsequent activation of synaptic vesicle fusion suggests 
a direct physical link between the Ca2+-channels and the synaptic vesicle release 
machinery (70, 62) (Fig. 2). 
Biochemical and immunocytochemical studies of brain neurons indicate 
association of syntaxin and synaptotagmin with Cav2 channels. Both CaV2.1 and 
CaV2.2 channels localize densely with syntaxin-1 at the presynaptic nerve terminals 
of many neurons and are crucial components in neuronal excitation-secretion 
coupling (11, 85, 86). Furthermore, these channels can be isolated as a complex with 
SNARE proteins from brain homogenates, suggesting that both types of Cav2 
channels are part of the synaptic vesicle fusion complexes (2, 94, 41). These findings 
sparked investigation into what molecular determinants allow these channels to bind 
SNARE proteins and how this interaction regulates synaptic transmission and 
channel function. 
 
 
Fig. 2. Physical and functional coupling of presynaptic CaV2 channels and synaptic vesicle 
fusion machinery. A synaptic vesicle docked near an open CaV2 channel within the 
microdomain of high Ca2+. Because the intracellular Ca2+ concentration drops steeply as a 
function of distance away from the Ca2+ entry sites, fast exocytosis occurs only in proximity to 
the Ca2+ channels. Binding of the SNARE proteins to the synprint site of CaV2 channels 
contributes to the efficiency of neurotransmitter release by localizing docked synaptic vesicles 
near sites of Ca2+ entry and maximizing Ca2+ influx through channels with nearby docked 
vesicles. Following vesicle exocytosis, the interaction between SNARE proteins and CaV2 
channels is disrupted to allow recovery of vesicle components and re-priming of the synaptic 
vesicle for release."

The large intracellular N- and C-terminal domains and the three loops that connect 
the four homologous domains of the α1 subunits of CaV2 channels are the most 
attractive candidates for synaptic protein interactions. In vitro biochemical analysis 
demonstrated that the SNARE proteins syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25, but not VAMP2, 
specifically interact with the Cav2.2 channel by binding to an amino acid sequence 
(residues 718–963) within the intracellular loop between domains II and III (LII-III) of 
α12.2 subunit (Fig. 3a, (61)), which comprises the synaptic protein interaction site, or 
synprint site. The synprint peptide blocks co-immunoprecipitation of native CaV2.2 
channels with syntaxin-1, indicating that this binding site is required for the stable 
interaction of these two proteins. Interestingly, this interaction is Ca2+-dependent, 
with maximal binding at 20 µM Ca2+ and reduced binding at low, resting Ca2+ 
concentrations and at concentrations above 50 µM (60). Although the physiological

subunits and G protein βγ subunits bind to adjacent sites in the intracellular loop connecting 
domains I and II. The domain II-III loop contains the synprint site, which binds syntaxin-1, 
SNAP-25, cysteine string protein (CPS), and synaptotagmin I. CaVβ subunits and G protein βγ 
subunits bind to secondary sites in the C-terminal domain, and the scaffolding proteins CASK 
and Mint also bind to specific sequences there. Adapted from (69). (b) A structural model of

secondary structural prediction algorithm, an ~80 amino acid length bundle with high 
probability of forming a helical domain is depicted extending from IIS6 into the loop LII-III. 
This helical segment is interrupted by a short random coil that precedes a second alpha helix 
containing the first binding site (B1; yellow box). Following this helical segment, a coil 
domain with collagen-like sequence homology (aa 823–848; hatched oval) is adjacent to the 
second binding site (B2; yellow box). Red balls mark the arginine- and histidine-rich clusters, 
which may serve as membrane surface interaction sites. The synprint B1 and B2 segments 
provide potential binding contact sites for the carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil (H3) of syntaxin-1 
in a closed confirmation (white arrows). Adapted from (92).

significance of this biphasic Ca2+–dependent interaction is not yet known, the 
reduction in binding affinity at high Ca2+ levels suggests sequential steps of 
association and dissociation of CaV2 channels with the SNARE complex as a 
function of Ca2+ concentration in order for fusion to proceed (62). 
Further structure-function studies defined the molecular determinants of the 
synprint site responsible for binding to syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25 more completely 
(92). Two different peptide segments, Cav2.2(773–786) and Cav2.2(872–901), are 
independently required to bind syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25 to two halves of the 
synprint site, which are separated by a linker sequence that contains a collagen-like 
strand with repeated proline and glycine residues (Fig. 3b). This structural motif is 
predicted to form an extended, flexible linker connecting the two SNARE-binding 
segments. Furthermore, the synprint sequence exhibits a high charge density with a 
charged residue found every 2.5 residues on average and repeated arginine-histidine-
rich sequences. This hydrophilic structure of the synprint site may hold it near the 
intracellular surface membrane to facilitate interactions with the hydrophilic surface 
of the amphipathic alpha helices of SNARE proteins and provide points of contact 
with phospholipids in the plasma membrane or in the docked synaptic vesicles, thus 
contributing to structural tethering of synaptic vesicles near presynaptic Cav2.2 
channels. 
Cav2.1 channels, which conduct P/Q-type Ca2+ currents, also contain a synprint 
site in their LII-III. Two isoforms of the α12.1 subunit of Cav2.1 channels, initially 
named BI and rbA, have different patterns of interactions with the SNARE proteins 
and exhibit different Ca2+-dependence (58, 34). The BI isoform interacts with both 
syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25, while the rbA isoform interacts with SNAP-25 but not 
with syntaxin-1. Given that these Ca2+ channels are differentially distributed in 
synapses in the central nervous system, the observed differences in the interactions 
between the channels and the SNARE proteins may produce subtle variations in the 
efficacy of the initiation of transmitter release in response to Ca2+ influx through 
these different channels and may confer specialized regulatory properties that 
contribute to synaptic modulation. 
The synprint site may be unique to Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 channels, because Cav1 
channels lack a similar synprint motif in the corresponding intracellular LII-III region 
(50). However, functional interactions of CaV1.2 channels with SNARE proteins 
have been reported, suggesting additional interaction mechanisms that do not involve 
the synprint site (89). 
Both Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 channels interact with the C-terminal coiled-coil domain 
or H3 helix of syntaxin-1A (181–288), suggesting that Ca2+ channels bind to 
syntaxin-1 at a C-terminal site near the intracellular surface of the plasma membrane 
(Fig. 3b (61)). The N-terminal sequence (1–69) of syntaxin-1A also binds the 
synprint site in vitro (31), though it is not clear whether this binding contributes to 
functional coupling between the SNARE proteins and Ca2+ channels at nerve 
terminals."

6.3 Synaptotagmin Binds to Presynaptic Ca2+ Channels 
Synaptotagmin has been widely accepted as the Ca2+-sensor for the SNARE-based 
release machinery (21, 74), with synaptotagmins-1, -2, and -9 playing the major role at 
fast synapses (90). Synaptotagmin-1 contains two homologous C2 domains, which 
bind Ca2+ to initiate synchronous transmitter release (74). Biochemical studies have 
revealed a complex of synaptotagmin-1 and both CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 channels in brain 
homogenates (63). The synprint site directly binds to the same region in the C2B 
domain of synaptotagmin-I required for synaptotagmin oligomerization and for AP-2 
binding. Two adjacent lysine residues (K326 and K327) within this region are critical 
for synaptotagmin oligomerization, AP-2, and synprint binding (10). Moreover, 
syntaxin interacts exclusively with either synprint or synaptotagmin in a Ca2+-
dependent manner, such that at low Ca2+ concentrations syntaxin-1 binds synprint 
whereas at higher concentrations (>30 µM) its association with synaptotagmin 
increases, providing a potential biochemical correlate for the sequential events 
occurring at the synprint site of presynaptic Ca2+ channels during synaptic vesicle 
exocytosis (60). Collectively, these studies suggest a versatile physical link of the 
neuronal CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 channels with the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery, 
enabling tight structural and functional coupling of the sites for Ca2+ entry and 
neurotransmitter release through sequential protein-protein interactions (62). 
6.4 Ca2+ Channel-SNARE Interaction Through the Synprint Site  
is Important for Efficient Release of Neurotransmitters 
The Ca2+ concentration at the nerve terminal drops steeply as a function of the 
distance from Ca2+ entry sites, requiring close association between presynaptic Ca2+ 
channels and the Ca2+ sensor of the release machinery for efficient initiation of 
exocytosis (72). Maintenance of such a critical intermolecular distance must involve 
anchoring of the release machinery to the source of the Ca2+ influx. Thus, the 
synprint-mediated interaction of Ca2+ channels and SNARE proteins provides an 
attractive model for interaction with the docked synaptic vesicles spatially localized 
within Ca2+ microdomains. 
Peptides derived from the synprint site competitively inhibit interactions between 
SNARE proteins and CaV2 channels in vitro, and therefore provide a potential test of 
the physiological significance of these interactions. Injection of synprint peptides 
from Cav2.2 channels into presynaptic superior cervical ganglion neurons (SCGNs) 
in culture significantly reduced the excitatory postsynaptic response by competitive 
uncoupling of the endogenous Ca2+ channel-SNARE interaction at nerve terminals 
(48). Rapid, synchronous synaptic transmission was selectively inhibited following 
the injection, while late asynchronous release and paired-pulse facilitation were 
increased. This is consistent with the assumption that synaptic vesicles are shifted 
from an optimally positioned pool for synchronous release to a more distant pool 
located too far away for rapid Ca2+ sensor response. Evidently, CaV2.2 channels have 
two distinct functional roles in neurotransmitter release: conducting Ca2+ entry and 
serving as a signaling platform for SNARE proteins and docked synaptic vesicles to 
bind and receive the local Ca2+ signal and initiate exocytosis (48)."
475,"===== Page 10 =====
156 
Z.-H. Sheng et al. 
 
The hypothesis that the inhibition of neurotransmitter release by the synprint 
peptides is due to the detachment of CaV2.2 channels from release sites was further 
tested in Xenopus nerve-muscle co-cultures (57). Injection of the synprint peptides 
into embryonic Xenopus spinal neurons reduced transmitter release by approximately 
50% when cells were stimulated in an extracellular solution containing physiological 
Ca2+ concentration. Increasing the external Ca2+ concentrations effectively rescued 
this inhibition, implying that the Ca2+ channels are competitively displaced away 
from docked synaptic vesicles by the injected synprint peptides and this effect can be 
overcome by flooding the presynaptic terminal with Ca2+ from the higher 
concentration in the extracellular pool. 
6.5 Additional Interactions that may Localize the Exocytotic Machinery 
Near Ca2+ Channels 
While the studies above indicate that interaction of the synprint site of presynaptic 
Ca2+ channels with SNARE proteins enhances the efficiency of neurotransmitter 
release in vertebrate neurons, several lines of evidence suggest that this interaction is 
not absolutely required for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. First, inhibition of synprint 
interaction or deletion of the synprint site on both Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 channels 
reduces the efficiency of synaptic transmission but does not completely abolish 
synaptic transmission and vesicle exocytosis (48, 57, 50, 25). Second, although 
invertebrate Cav2 channels effectively initiate synaptic transmission, they lack a 
synprint site (68). In invertebrates, other protein-protein interactions may substitute 
for interaction with the synprint site of Ca2+ channels in spatial organization of the 
exocytosis process (68), or neurotransmitter release may be less dependent on local 
organization than in vertebrates. Splice variants of the human CaV2.2 channels 
lacking the synprint region have been identified, but their localization in nerve 
terminals and their physiological relevance in supporting synaptic transmission are not 
Deletion of the synprint site in the Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 channels also affects 
synaptic vesicle release at nerve terminals and exocytosis in secretory cells. Deletion 
of the synprint site on the Cav2.1 P/Q-type channel results in a substantial reduction 
in neurotransmitter release in transfected SCG neurons, correlated with reduced 
localization of the mutant channels to presynaptic terminals (49, 50). Transfer of the 
synprint sequence from Cav2.1 to Cav1.2 channels, which conduct L-type Ca2+ 
currents and are ineffective in supporting synaptic transmission, is sufficient to allow 
these channels to initiate synaptic transmission. A related study addressed this issue 
using mouse pheochromocytoma (MPC) 9/3L cells, which lack voltage-gated Ca2+ 
channels (25). Compared to cells transiently expressing wild-type Cav2.2 channels, 
cells expressing the synprint deletion mutant showed a substantial reduction in rate 
of secretion determined by capacitance measurements, even though Ca2+ currents 
were similar regardless of whether synprint is deleted. In addition, in transfected 
neurons in cell culture, localization of CaV2 channels to nerve terminals is 
substantially reduced when the synprint site is partially or completely deleted (76). 
These studies further support the concept that the synprint site is necessary for 
efficient presynaptic localization and functional coupling of Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 
channels to vesicle exocytosis (Figs. 2 and 3)."

known (32). These findings raise the question of whether these splice variants couple 
to the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery or have other physiological roles (69). 
The SNARE proteins are not selectively localized at nerve terminals. Therefore, 
while interaction with SNARE proteins may be required for efficient presynaptic 
localization, it seems unlikely that interactions with SNARE proteins can serve as a 
primary targeting mechanism for CaV2 channels. Consistent with this idea, the active 
zone scaffolding proteins Mint and CASK also play critical roles in the presynaptic 
targeting of CaV2.2 channels via direct interactions with the C-terminal tail of the 
channels (46). Moreover, in invertebrate Ca2+ channels that lack a synprint site, Mint 
and CASK are required for targeting of presynaptic Ca2+ channels to the synapse (68, 
69). Interactions with Mint and CASK, and perhaps with other unidentified targeting 
proteins, may represent the primary targeting signals required for the localization of 
the presynaptic Ca2+ channels in the nerve terminals. 
7 Regulation of Presynaptic Ca2+ Channels by SNARE Proteins 
7.1 Biphasic Regulation of Calcium Channel Inactivation by SNARE 
Proteins 
In addition to linking presynaptic Ca2+ channels to the vesicle release machinery, 
syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25 also regulate channel function. This retrograde regulation 
serves as a negative feedback mechanism for the modulation of synaptic 
transmission. Co-expression of syntaxin-1A and/or SNAP-25 with Cav2.1 or Cav2.2 
channels reduces the availability of the channels to open and shifts the voltage 
dependence of steady-state inactivation towards more negative membrane potentials 
(3, 87, 95). These inhibitory effects of syntaxin on CaV2.2 channels can be reversed 
by co-expressing SNAP-25 (87, 31), and the inhibitory effects of SNAP-25 on 
CaV2.1 channels can be relieved by co-expressing synaptotagmin-1 (88, 95). These 
physiological data correlate with biochemical observations that syntaxin interacts 
exclusively with either synprint or synaptotagmin in a Ca2+-dependent manner (63). 
This relief of inhibition of Ca2+ channels by formation of a complete 
synaptotagmin/SNARE complex favors Ca2+ influx through CaV2 channels near 
docked synaptic vesicles that are ready for release. Thus, this regulatory mechanism 
can provide selective Ca2+ entry through CaV2 channels with associated docked 
vesicles, whereas channels associated with only one t-SNARE protein would remain 
relatively inactive. This regulatory mechanism also allows the modulatory 
interaction of the channels to be switched on and off at appropriate stages of 
formation of nearby complexes of the SNARE proteins and synaptic vesicles. The 
inhibitory role of syntaxin-1 on channel opening is also abolished in the presence of 
nSec-1, a protein that blocks the assembly of the SNARE complex by locking 
syntaxin-1 in a closed conformation (31). Altogether, these findings support a 
biphasic model for the SNARE-mediated modulation of presynaptic Ca2+ channels 
based on the availability of docked synaptic vesicles nearby that are ready for rapid 
release."

7.2 Separate Anchoring and Regulatory Sites on Syntaxin-1  
By combining site-directed mutagenesis with functional expression in Xenopus 
oocytes, Bezprozvanny et al. (4) further addressed whether the anchoring and 
modulatory interactions between syntaxin-1 and Ca2+ channels are mediated by the 
same molecular determinants. Their studies showed that the transmembrane region 
and a short segment within the H3 helical cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin-1A are 
critical for channel modulation but not for binding to the synprint site of the N-
type Ca2+ channels. Given that this short segment is buried within the core of the 
four-helix structure of the SNARE complex, the modulatory action of syntaxin-1A 
can be enabled only after disassembly of the SNARE complex following synaptic 
vesicle exocytosis. The synprint site binds to the whole H3 region of syntaxin-1A 
(4), in agreement with the previous biochemical findings (61, 60). Deletion of the 
synprint site weakened the modulation of the channels by syntaxin-1A, but did not 
abolish it, arguing that the synprint sequence acts as an important anchor in 
facilitating channel modulation but is not absolutely essential for the modulatory 
action. Identification of partially separate anchoring and modulation sites on CaV2 
channels provides a means to test the relative roles of these synprint functions in 
synaptic transmission. 
7.3 Functional Roles of Vesicle Tethering and CaV2 Channel Regulation 
Via the Synprint Site in Synaptic Transmission in vivo 
At first glance, it seems that interactions of CaV2 channels with SNARE proteins 
have two opposing effects: tethering synaptic vesicles near the point of Ca2+ entry 
would increase synaptic transmission whereas enhancing CaV2 channel 
inactivation would reduce synaptic transmission. These effects were dissected by 
use of competing synprint peptides and mutant syntaxin in Xenopus neuromuscular 
junctions in vivo (33). Injection of competing synprint peptides into developing 
neuromuscular junctions reduced the basal efficiency of synaptic transmission, as 
reflected in increased paired-pulse facilitation and reduced quantal content of 
synaptic transmission. Evidently, the effect of the synprint peptide to reduce 
linkage of docked synaptic vesicles to CaV2 channels is predominant, because its 
effect to relieve inhibition of Ca2+ channels by individual plasma membrane 
SNARE proteins would primarily affect channels with no docked vesicles that do 
not effectively initiate transmitter release. In contrast, over-expression of a 
syntaxin mutant that is unable to regulate CaV2.2 channels but still binds to them 
increased the efficiency of synaptic transmission, as reflected in reduced paired-
pulse facilitation and increased quantal content (33). In this case, the syntaxin 
mutant relieves enhanced inactivation of CaV2.2 channels caused by endogenous 
syntaxin, thereby increasing Ca2+ entry and synaptic transmission, but does not 
alter linkage of docked synaptic vesicles to CaV2.2 channels. These results 
demonstrate a bidirectional regulation of synaptic transmission in vivo by 
interactions of SNARE proteins with CaV2.2 channels."

7.4 Crosstalk Between Syntaxin and G-Protein Regulation of Cav2.2 
Channels 
7.5 Additional SNARE-Binding Proteins add Complexity to Regulation 
of CaV2 Channels 
The SNARE complex together with synaptotagmin is thought to be the minimal 
essential machinery required for Ca2+-dependent synaptic vesicle fusion. However, a 
multitude of presynaptic proteins have been identified that directly participate in 
exocytosis or regulate the synaptic vesicle cycle via interactions with the SNARE 
proteins. These interactions have a potential impact on the modulation of the 
SNARE-CaV2 channel complex. RIM (Rab-Interacting Molecule), an active zone 
protein that is required for synaptic transmission and is implicated in short- and long-
term synaptic plasticity, has also been reported to interact with the synprint region in 
vitro (12). In addition, RIM interacts with CaVβ subunits and shifts the voltage 
dependence of inactivation to more positive membrane potentials, increasing Ca2+ 
channel activity (35). In the neuroendocrine cell line PC12, interaction of RIM with 
CaV2.2 channels increases docking of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles (35). 
Cysteine string protein (CSP) was identified as a synaptic vesicle-associated protein 
with the ability to modify Ca2+ influx in Drosophila and Torpedo (82). Subsequent 
studies demonstrated that CSP interacts with the synprint site of CaV2 channels and 
that this interaction results in a robust tonic inhibition of channel activity by G-
protein βγ-subunits (42). Regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ channel function and vesicle 
docking by RIM and CSP provides additional pathways for control of Ca2+ channel 
activity in response to the state of nearby docked synaptic vesicles. 
8 Modulation of the SNARE-Synprint Interaction by Protein 
Phosphorylation 
Second messenger-activated regulation of neurotransmitter release via modulation of 
protein interactions within the exocytotic apparatus has a potentially important role 
in synaptic plasticity. Several protein kinases, including PKA, PKC, PKG, and 
Further regulation of the Cav2.2 channels involves the interplay between the synprint 
site interactions and the second messenger modulation of calcium channels by  
G-proteins. Stanley and Mirotznik (73) revealed that syntaxin-1A is required for  
G-protein inhibition of presynaptic calcium channels in intact nerve terminals. 
Botulinum toxin, which cleaves syntaxin-1A, prevents G-protein modulation of 
presynaptic Ca2+ channels in chick calyx synapses, suggesting a crosstalk mechanism 
between syntaxin-1A and the G-protein effects on the N-type Ca2+ channels. Further 
studies by Jarvis et al. (30) showed that the synprint site and Gβ subunit bind to 
distinct portions of syntaxin-1A and that expression of syntaxin-1A appears to be a 
prerequisite for tonic G-protein inhibition of the N-type Ca2+ channels. These results 
support the hypothesis that syntaxin-1A acts as a chaperone by tethering Gβ  to 
CaV2.2 channels in synapses, thus facilitating G-protein regulation."

CaMKII, are expressed in presynaptic terminals and phosphorylate Ca2+ channels 
and SNARE proteins. Phosphorylation of the synprint peptide by PKC and CaMKII 
in vitro strongly inhibits its binding to recombinant syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25 and 
prevents its association with the native SNARE complex isolated from rat brain 
homogenates (93). Moreover, PKC phosphorylation blocks the negative shift of 
steady-state inactivation of Cav2.2 channels, possibly by reducing binding of 
syntaxin-1 to the synprint site (31). A more detailed analysis of these 
phosphorylation sites reveals a bipartite mode of regulation of SNARE protein 
binding, in which the two separate domains of the synprint site that each bind 
syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 in vitro are regulated by PKC phosphorylation at serines 
774 and 898 and by CaMKII phosphorylation at serines 784 and 896 (92) (Fig. 3b). 
Each phosphorylation site can control syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 binding to half of the 
synprint site. However, phosphorylation of the intact Cav2.2 channels before 
exposure to syntaxin-1A reduces the binding affinity to syntaxin-1A, but does not 
completely prevent binding (92). These observations are consistent with functional 
studies, in which PKC activation in transfected tsA-201 cells does not completely 
dissociate syntaxin-1A from the channels but does completely reverse the negative 
shift of the voltage dependence of inactivation caused by syntaxin-1A (92). These 
studies suggest that phosphorylation of the synprint site by PKC or CaMKII may 
serve as a biochemical switch for the SNARE-synprint interaction and regulation of 
channel function. 
9 Ca2+-Dependent Regulation of Presynaptic Ca2+ Channels 
Ca2+ entering presynaptic nerve terminals through Ca2+ channels forms a local micro-
domain of high concentration near the intracellular mouth of the channel (44, 65, 
71). In order to respond to this local Ca2+ signal, Ca2+-dependent signaling proteins 
must be located near the Ca2+ channel in order to sense this Ca2+ transient. Therefore, 
many proteins that respond to local Ca2+ transients in presynaptic terminals in order 
to initiate or regulate neurotransmission bind directly to the intracellular domains of 
CaV2 channels. 
9.1 Ca2+-dependent Regulation of CaV1 and CaV2 Channels 
Although all Cav channels readily conduct both Ca2+ and Ba2+ ions, L-type and P/Q-
type Ca2+ currents inactivate strikingly faster than Ba2+ currents (7). This process, 
Ca2+-dependent inactivation, prevents Ca2+ overload and refines activity-dependent 
Ca2+ signals in excitable cells. Ca2+-dependent inactivation of L-type Ca2+ currents 
conducted by CaV1.2 channels in cardiac myocytes and other cell types is observed 
in the presence of high concentrations of intracellular EGTA in the recording pipette, 
indicating that the inactivation process binds entering Ca2+ rapidly and with high 
affinity, before Ca2+ ions are chelated by EGTA (29). 
Ca2+-dependent inactivation was long considered specific for L-type Ca2+ 
currents, in part because most whole-cell patch clamp recordings employ high 
concentrations of EGTA or BAPTA (5–10 mM) in the intracellular recording"

9.2 Regulation of Cav1 Channels by Calmodulin 
Ca2+-feedback for Cav1 channels involves the ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein 
calmodulin (100, 53, 56, 98). For Cav1.2 channels, calmodulin binds to a consensus 
site (IQ-domain) in the C-terminal domain of α11.2 ((99). Ca2+ ions permeating the 
channel bind EF-hand motifs in the N- and C-terminal lobes of calmodulin, causing 
conformational changes that favor inactivation. Ba2+ ions bind poorly to calmodulin, 
and so cannot support rapid inactivation of Ba2+ currents. Calmodulin interactions 
 
solution, which are permissive for Ca2+-dependent inactivation of L-type currents. 
However, with EGTA reduced to 0.5 mM, a level of buffering more similar to 
intracellular conditions, Ca2+-dependent inactivation for Cav2.1 channels transfected 
in noneuronal cells is robust (39, 37) (Fig. 4a, b), similar to presynaptic P/Q-type 
currents at the calyx of Held, a giant synapse in the brainstem (20). During trains of 
depolarizations, P/Q-type Ca2+ currents increase in size during the first pulses due to 
facilitation and then inactivate faster during repeated pulses than Ba2+ currents (37) 
(Fig. 4c). Inactivation, but not facilitation, is prevented by a high intracellular 
concentration of EGTA (10 mM) (37). These results indicate that the facilitation 
process has higher affinity and/or more rapid binding of Ca2+ than the inactivation 
process. This dual feedback regulation may permit activity-dependent sharpening of 
presynaptic Ca2+ signals underlying synaptic plasticity, providing a boost of synaptic 
efficiency during short trains of impulses and then reduction of synaptic efficacy 
during long trains. With low concentrations of EGTA (0.5 mM), Ca2+-dependent 
inactivation is also observed for Cav2.2 and Cav2.3 channels (43). Therefore, all three 
Cav2 family channels show Ca2+-dependent feedback regulation that is sensitive to 
the Ca2+ buffering conditions of the cell, unlike CaV1 channels.

9.3 Ca2+-Dependent Facilitation and Inactivation of CaV2.1 Channels 
The two lobes of calmodulin interact differentially with the two calmodulin-
binding subsites in the C-terminal domain of CaV2.1 channels (40). Mutations of the 
IQ-like domain primarily impair facilitation, indicating that they interact primarily 
with the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin (14, 40). In contrast, mutations of the CBD 
primarily impair Ca2+-dependent inactivation (40), suggesting that they interact 
primarily with the lower affinity N-terminal lobe of calmodulin. These results lead to 
a model in which rapid, high-affinity binding of Ca2+ to the C-terminal lobe of 
calmodulin and interaction with the IQ-like motif of CaV2.1 channels causes 
facilitation, whereas subsequent slower and/or lower affinity binding of Ca2+ to the 
N-terminal lobe of calmodulin and interaction with the CBD of CaV2.1 channels 
causes inactivation (Fig. 5). 
 
 
 
 
with the α11.2 IQ-domain are functionally complex: mutation of the initial isoleucine 
to glutamate abolishes Ca2+-dependent inactivation, but substitution of alanine for 
this residue reveals Ca2+-dependent facilitation, which is normally masked by intense 
Ca2+-dependent inactivation for Cav1.2 channels expressed in recombinant systems 
(99, 54). Structural and functional studies demonstrate positive and negative Ca2+-
feedback dependent on the N- and C-terminal lobes of calmodulin, respectively, 
which make contacts with different residues in the IQ-domain. Among different Cav1 
channels, the IQ-domain and other sequences (Pre-IQ and EF-hand) required for 
Ca2+-dependent inactivation are nearly identical, illustrating the essential nature of 
these determinants for Cav1 channel function. 
Both facilitation and inactivation of CaV2.1 channels are dependent on calmodulin 
(39, 37, 14). In the C-terminal domain of the α12.1 subunit, calmodulin interacts with 
a modified IQ-like domain, which begins with the sequence isoleucine-methionine 
(IM) rather than isoleucine-glutamine (IQ), and with a nearby downstream second 
site, the calmodulin binding domain (CBD), both of which are involved in Ca2+-
dependent feedback regulation ((14, 40); Fig. 5). Ca2+-dependent facilitation is 
impaired by mutations in the IQ-like domain of α12.1 or by calmodulin mutants 
unable to bind Ca2+ at the C-terminal EF-hands. In contrast, Ca2+-dependent 
inactivation is inhibited by deletion of the CBD of α12.1 or by mutations of the Ca2+-
binding sites in the N-terminal lobe of calmodulin (14, 40). Since the C-terminal lobe 
of calmodulin binds Ca2+ with higher affinity than the N-terminal lobe, the 
dependence of Ca2+-dependent facilitation of CaV2.1 channels on the C-terminal of 
calmodulin may be responsible for its ability to respond to local increases in Ca2+ in 
the presence of a high concentration of EGTA. Similarly, the increased Ca2+-buffer 
sensitivity of Ca2+-dependent inactivation for Cav2.1 channels compared to Cav1.2 
channels may reflect Ca2+ binding to the lower affinity N-terminal lobe for 
inactivation of CaV2.1 channels versus the higher affinity C-terminal lobe for CaV2.1 
channels."

10 Regulation of Presynaptic CaV Channels by Calmodulin-Like 
Ca2+-binding Proteins 
10.1 Regulation of Cav2.1 Channels by CaBP 
CaBP1 is a member of a subfamily of nCaBPs highly expressed in the brain and 
retina (24) and is colocalized with presynaptic Cav2.1 channels in some synapses 
(38). Like calmodulin, CaBP1 binds to the CBD of α12.1, but its binding is Ca2+-
independent (38). It causes rapid inactivation that is independent of Ca2+, and it does 
not support Ca2+-dependent facilitation (38) (Fig. 4c). A second nCaBP that 
modulates Cav2.1 channels is visinin-like protein-2 (VILIP-2), which is highly 
expressed in the neocortex and hippocampus and undergoes Ca2+-dependent 
 
Fig. 5. Binding sites for Ca2+-binding proteins mediating Ca2+-dependent modulation of 
Cav2.1 channels. Each homologous domain of the Cav2.1 channels is illustrated as a cylinder. 
Binding sites in the C-terminus of the α12.1 subunit for calmodulin (CaM), CaBP1, and 
VILIP-2, and potentially NCS-1 are indicated. 
Calmodulin is the primordial member of a large family of EF-hand Ca2+ binding 
proteins, some of which are expressed specifically in neurons (nCaBPs; (5, 23)). 
Like calmodulin, these CaBPs possess four EF-hand Ca2+ binding sites organized in 
two lobes connected by an α-helix. At least one of the N-terminal EF-hands of the 
nCaBPs is nonfunctional in Ca2+ binding due to changes in amino acid sequence, and 
some of the nCaBPs are myristolyated at their N-terminus (5). nCaBPs are similar 
enough to displace calmodulin from shared binding sites in the α1 subunits of CaV 
channels, but different enough to confer distinct forms of regulation."

association with the plasma membrane in neurons and other cell-types (36). When 
cotransfected with Cav2.1 channels in mammalian cells, VILIP-2 does not affect 
Ca2+-dependent facilitation, but inhibits Ca2+-dependent and voltage-dependent 
inactivation (36) (Fig. 4c). These effects of VILIP-2 may involve displacement of 
calmodulin from the CBD, because both the CBD and IQ-like motifs of α12.1 are 
required for binding of VILIP-2. Thus, CaBP-1 and VILIP-2 bind to the same site as 
calmodulin but have differential effects on CaV2.1 channel activity. In a presynaptic 
terminal, these differential effects on facilitation and inactivation of the P/Q-type 
Ca2+ current would substantially change the encoding properties of the synapse in 
response to trains of action potentials (97). 
How can VILIP-2 and CaBP1 have such opposing effects on Cav2.1 function? 
The mechanism for these effects is not yet clear, but both proteins must be 
myristolyated on the N-termini to have their distinctive regulatory effects (19). 
Because calmodulin is not myristoylated at its N-terminal and does not have an 
inactive N-terminal EF-hand, it is tempting to think that differential interactions of 
the inactive EF-hands in the N-terminal domains of these Ca2+-binding proteins with 
the IQ-like domain and CBD of CaV2.1 channels are responsible for their differences 
in action. The divergent actions of nCaBPs on Cav2.1 channels may fine-tune the 
function and regulatory properties of presynaptic P/Q-type Ca2+ currents, allowing a 
greater range of input-output relationships and short-term plasticity at different 
synapses. 
Cav2.1 channels also interact with other CaBPs, including neuronal Ca2+ sensor-1 
(NCS-1), which has inhibitory effects on the amplitude of P/Q-type Ca2+ currents in 
adrenal chromaffin cells that are mediated by a tyrosine kinase signaling pathway 
(83, 5, 84). However, injection of purified NCS-1 protein into presynaptic nerve 
terminals at the calyx of Held synapse promotes facilitation of P/Q-type currents, and 
activity-dependent facilitation of P/Q-type currents at this synapse can be prevented 
by injection of NCS-1-inhibitor peptides (81). Similarly, NCS-1 can enhance 
facilitation of synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons (64). 
Therefore, the effects of NCS-1 on Cav2.1 channels may depend on the cellular 
context in which they are co-expressed, but in synapses it appears to act as an 
enhancer of Ca2+ channel activity and synaptic transmission. 
10.2 Regulation of Cav1 Channels by CaBP 
The Cav1 family of Ca2+ channels are also differentially regulated by CaBPs (96). 
Unlike its inhibitory effects on Cav2.1 channels, CaBP1 prolongs Cav1.2 Ca2+ 
currents and completely abolishes Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent inactivation. The 
opposing actions of calmodulin and CaBP1 on Cav1.2 depend on differences in how 
the two interact with the channel (96). CaBP1 binds to the IQ-domain as well as to a 
site in the N-terminal domain of the α11.2 subunit. Deletion of the N-terminal site 
prevents the effects of CaBP1 but not calmodulin on Cav1.2 inactivation. In contrast, 
IQ-EE substitutions in the IQ-domain prevent calmodulin-dependent inactivation, 
but partially spare the effects of CaBP1. Interestingly, a CaBP1 variant, caldendrin, 
causes more modest suppression of Cav1.2 Ca2+-dependent inactivation than CaBP1 
through interactions solely with the IQ-domain and not the N-terminal site in α11.2"

(78). CaBP1 and caldendrin associate and colocalize with Cav1.2 in somatodendritic 
domains of neurons, and so may help fine-tune and boost postsynaptic Ca2+ signals 
conducted by Cav2.1, which regulate gene transcription and neuronal excitability. 
11 Regulation of CaV2 Channels and Synaptic Plasticity 
CaV1.4 channels conduct L-type Ca2+ currents that initiate transmitter release at 
specialized ribbon synapses in sensory cells in the retinal photoreceptors and bipolar 
cells (26). CaV1.4 channels interact with the calmodulin-like Ca2+ binding protein 
CaBP4, which is essential for normal formation and function of the photoreceptor 
synapse. Interaction with CaBP-4 increases CaV1.4 channel activity by negatively 
shifting its voltage dependence of activation. This regulatory effect of CaBP4 may 
regulate synaptic transmission at the ribbon synapses of photoreceptor cells (22). 
Short-term synaptic plasticity of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals 
shapes the response of postsynaptic neurons to bursts of impulses and is crucial for 
fine-grained encoding of information in the nervous system (97). This form of 
synaptic plasticity is thought to be mediated by residual Ca2+ in the cytosol of the 
presynaptic terminal remaining from previous stimuli, but the molecular mechanisms 
responsible for this form of synaptic plasticity are unknown. During trains of stimuli 
at many synapses, facilitation of neurotransmitter release increases the postsynaptic 
response, and subsequent depression of neurotransmitter release reduces it. Activity-
dependent regulation of presynaptic calcium channels is predicted to have profound 
effects on short-term synaptic plasticity because the amount of neurotransmitter 
released at a synapse is steeply dependent on calcium entry, approximately 
proportional to n3.5 of extracellular Ca2+ (15). In order to critically test the role of 
activity-dependent regulation of presynaptic calcium channels via calmodulin and 
nCaBPs in short-term synaptic plasticity, it is necessary to compare synaptic 
transmission initiated by wild-type CaV2.1 channels and by mutant channels with 
impaired activity-dependent regulation. This is a challenging experiment because 
endogenous Ca2+ channels are present in high concentration in presynaptic active 
zones, and replacement of them with exogenously expressed mutant Ca2+ channels is 
difficult. Cultured superior cervical ganglion neurons can be transfected successfully 
with cDNA encoding CaV2.1 channels by microinjection, and these transfected 
neurons then express functional CaV2.1 channels in their cell bodies and synapses 
(49). Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of transfected CaV2.1 channels at the cell 
body show that they undergo Ca2+-dependent facilitation like CaV2.1 channels 
expressed in non-neuronal cells (50a). The contribution of these transfected CaV2.1 
channels to initiation of synaptic transmission can then be determined by blocking 
the endogenous N-type calcium current specifically with ω-conotoxin GVIA. 
Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) recorded in the postsynaptic neurons in 
response to action potentials elicited in the presynaptic neuron are approximately 30–
40% of the size of those initiated by endogenous N-type Ca2+ currents (49). In 
contrast, transfected CaV1.2 channels and CaV2.3 channels are much less effective 
(49). Recent studies using this model synaptic system show that activity-dependent 
facilitation and inactivation of transfected CaV2.1 channels mediated by nCaBPs"

12 Conclusion 
Signaling complexes formed by presynaptic CaV channels have three crucial 
functions. First, the presynaptic Ca2+ channel provides the rapid, spatially focused 
Ca2+ entry that initiates synaptic transmission. Second, through specific protein-
protein interactions with SNARE proteins and scaffolding proteins, the presynaptic 
Ca2+ channels bring docked synaptic vesicles close to the source of Ca2+ entry, allow 
them to respond efficiently to the micordomain of high Ca2+ concentration, and 
mediate regulatory effects that serve to focus Ca2+ entry on sites with docked 
synaptic vesicles. Third, through specific protein-protein interactions with Ca2+-
binding proteins, the presynaptic Ca2+ channels respond to residual Ca2+ in nerve 
terminals and mediate important aspects of short-term synaptic plasticity, including 
paired-pulse facilitation and depression, and facilitation and depression during trains 
of stimuli.

neurons, including paired-pulse facilitation and depression as well as synaptic 
facilitation, augmentation, post-tetanic potentiation, and depression during trains of

mutation in the IQ-like motif in the C-terminal domain that blocks Ca2+/calmodulin-
dependent facilitation of P/Q-type calcium currents prevented paired-pulse 
facilitation and markedly reduced synaptic facilitation and augmentation during

which reduces Ca2+-dependent inactivation in heterologous expression systems, 
prevented paired-pulse depression and also substantially reduced depression of 
EPSPs during trains of action potentials (50a). These results establish a new

depletion, is the primary cause of the rapid phase of synaptic depression at this 
model synapse. These results point to activity-dependent dual regulation of 
presynaptic Ca2+ channels by calmodulin and nCaBP proteins as a primary 
determinant of short-term synaptic plasticity and information-processing in the 
nervous system."

Adhesion Molecules at the Synapse 
Alaa El-Husseini 
University of British Columbia, Department of Psychiatry, Vancouver, British Columbia, 
Canada alaa@interchange.ubc.ca 
Abstract. Communication between neurons is mediated mainly by chemical synapses, at 
which neurotransmitters are released by the presynaptic neuron, diffuse across the narrow 
cleft, and activate receptors located on postsynaptic neurons. Synapses provide the structural 
and functional basis for the formation and maintenance of the complex neural networks that 
exist in the brain. This process is governed by the number, type, and location of synapses 
control synapse maturation, specificity and function. Thus, disruption of the adhesive proper-
ties of these molecules not only compromises synaptic transmission, but also many aspects of 
brain function that control memory formation and behavior. Here, I will describe the various 
stages of synaptogenesis, with focus on adhesion molecules that regulate contact initiation, 
synapse maturation/stabilization or elimination, and synaptic plasticity. Emphasis will be on 
the potential mechanisms that regulate adhesion molecule recruitment and function at the 
synapse. I will also discuss how dysfunction in specific adhesive systems may contribute to 
synaptic imbalance and the development of brain disorders. 
1 Introduction 
1.1 Mechanisms That Govern Synapse Development 
Synapses form when axons reach their target cells and establish stable contacts 
with them. This process requires spatially and temporally controlled changes in 
contact structure as well as recruitment of specific proteins to contact sites (18, 26, 
39, 45, 74, 75, 154, 191, 197). The axon terminal, the so-called presynaptic side, is 
engorged with synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters, the chemical basis 
of neuron to neuron communication. These vesicles are docked on the presynaptic 
membrane, attached by a complex cytomatrix of proteins, primed for the proper 
signal for release. At postsynaptic sites, neurotransmitter receptors and a wide 
formed. Therefore, specialized molecular machinery must exist to ensure assembly of appro-
priate synaptic partners. There is considerable evidence that synaptic contact formation and 
remodeling is regulated by adhesion molecules that modulate the stabilization and mainte-
nance of initial contacts between neuronal cells, as well as recruitment of other molecules that

2.2 Molecular and Functional Determinants of Neuroligin/Neurexin 
Interaction 
Neuroligins belong to a large family of adhesion molecules, known as choli-
nesterase-like adhesion molecules (CLAMs), which include the invertebrate proteins, 
glutactin, neurotactin and gliotactin (77). The hallmark of CLAMs distinguishing 
them from cholinesterases is the lack of various residues in the catalytic triad of the 
extracellular cholinesterase-like domain, rendering these proteins enzymatically 
inactive. Four genes encoding neuroligin family members have been identified in 
rodents, with at least five genes coding for neuroligins in humans (12). Neuroligins 
are type I transmembrane proteins containing three major domains that regulate their 
function: a cholinesterase-like domain (CLD), an O-glycosylation cassette, and a 
SynGAP, as well as the excitatory neurotransmitter receptor subunit NR1. Some of the mole-
cules thought to regulate neuroligin actions in excitatory synapse maturation as well as mole-
cules involved in modulating synaptic strength, retrograde signaling and plasticity are 
indicated. For a more comprehensive overview of the molecules that regulate neuroligins and 
neurexins action at the synapse see reference (122)."

short C-terminal tail containing a type I PDZ binding motif (90). The extracellular 
region of neuroligins is thought to mediate receptor/ligand-like interaction implicated 
in cell–cell adhesion. Comparison of rat sequences revealed that the intracellular 
regions are the least conserved, with only 31% identity. As such, this divergence 
may underlie the differential localizations and/or functions of neuroligin family 
members. Neuroligin-1, the most characterized member of the family, was first puri-
fied from brain lysates by affinity chromatography on immobilized neurexin 1β 
lacking an insert in the alternatively spliced G domain, also referred as splice site 4 
(90). Additional neuroligin family members have subsequently been identified as 
splice-site specific ligands for β-neurexins (91). 
Neurexins are the products of three genes, from which two classes of mRNAs 
are generated: long mRNAs encoding the α-neurexins, and short mRNAs which 
encode the β-neurexins. Thus, at least 6 principal neurexin isoforms are expressed in 
the brain; three α-neurexins (Iα, IIα, IIIα) and three β-neurexins (Iβ, IIβ, IIIβ) (180, 
181). Both α- and β-neurexins are single transmembrane proteins, with distinct N-
terminal sequences that contain the LNS domain, named after repeated sequences of 
Laminin A, Neurexin, and Sex hormone-binding protein. LNS domains are also 
referred to as G domains, in reference to domain repeats present in laminin A, agrin, 
and slit, proteins implicated in cell recognition processes during development of the 
nervous system (182, 148). In α-neurexin, the LNS domains are part of a three-
repeat cassette, each repeat containing 2 LNS domains (A and B) separated by an 
epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) sequence. In comparison, β-neurexins contain 
only the last LNS unit, which is preceded by a β-neurexin-specific sequence result-
ing from the N-terminal truncation of a long, atypical signal peptide (181, 182). In all 
neurexins, the last LNS unit is followed by a carbohydrate attachment sequence, a 
single transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail containing a type II PDZ 
recognition motif. Neurexins also have multiple alternatively spliced regions making 
them highly polymorphic. Neuroligins can bind to both α- and β-neurexins, depend-
ing on alternative splicing of neuroligins at splice site B (13). 
2.3 Balancing Excitation and Inhibition by Neuroligins and Neurexins 
An important finding emerging from recent studies on the effects of neuroligins on 
synapse induction, is their ability to influence not only excitatory synapse develop-
ment, but also inhibitory synapse differentiation and function (31, 33, 119, 143, 184). 
The first evidence for a role for neuroligins in driving maturation of inhibitory syn-
apses came from work performed by Prange et al. (143), showing that neuroligin-1 
not only induces excitatory presynaptic contact formation, but also the maturation of 
GABAergic synapses when overexpressed in hippocampal neurons (143). Later, it 
was discovered that these effects can be reproduced to varying extents by all mem-
bers of the neuroligin family (30, 80, 117). Endogenously however, neuroligin-1 and 
-3 are enriched at excitatory synapses, whereas neuroligin-2 is found mainly at in-
hibitory synapses (31, 117, 166, 185). 
The effects on excitatory and inhibitory contacts seem to require coupling to 
neurexin, since application of soluble β-neurexin extracellular domain reduced"

frequency of excitatory and inhibitory currents (118). Other studies showed that β-
neurexin has the ability to induce the clustering of neuroligins and other postsynaptic 
proteins normally present at both types of synapses. Moreover, while neuroligin-1, -
3, and –4 co-aggregated mainly with PSD-95, neuroligin-2 co-aggregated signifi-
cantly more with gephyrin, a scaffolding protein found mainly at inhibitory postsy-
naptic sites (80). Studies of a similar design showed that coexpression of neuroligin-
functional GABAergic synapses (53). Interestingly, while presentation of β-neurexin 
induces clustering of both PSD-95 and NMDA receptors, no clustering of AMPA 
type glutamate receptors was observed (80, 131). Additional experiments demon-
strated that AMPA receptors are recruited upon application of glutamate or overex-
to resemble silent synapses which become functional at later stages of synapse de-
velopment, via recruitment of AMPA receptors. However, despite the ability of 
neuroligins to induce recruitment of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins to 
contact sites, their physiological role seems to be more to exert specific effects on 
synaptic activity. For example, neuroligin-1 expressed in both non-neuronal and 
neuronal cells enhances excitatory synaptic activity, while expression of neuroligin-2 
enhances inhibitory synaptic currents (33, 53, 70, 131, 165). Further work must be 
carried out to clarify mechanisms that control targeting and function of specific neu-
roligins at different synapse types. 
In addition to modulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse maturation, 
recent evidence indicates that neuroligins also enhance nicotinic synapse maturation 
(36). Namely, overexpression of neuroligins in neurons induces presynaptic speciali-
zations in adjacent cholinergic neurons. In addition, manipulation of endogenous 
neuroligin function with dominant negative constructs and siRNA compromises 
nicotinic synaptic function. How neuroligins are able to drive the maturation of het-
erogeneous types of synapses using the same presynaptic partner remains unclear. 
Secondary presynaptic binding partners or crosstalk with other adhesion systems 
may account for this phenomenon, but this remains to be determined. 
2.4 Regulation of Neuroligin/Neurexin Trafficking and Assembly 
Recent studies revealed that neuroligins and neurexins have the inherent ability to 
affect both excitatory and inhibitory synapse maturation. The question then arises, if 
neuroligins and neurexins have the ability to modulate both types of contacts, what 
accounts for their proper sorting to a particular synapse in vivo? One potential 
mechanism that influences the recruitment of neuroligins to particular synapse types, 
is alternative splicing (90, 91). Although the N-terminal regions of neuroligins share 
a relatively high degree of sequence similarity, the splice sites found within these 
regions provide differing sequences which may be used to direct targeting of these 
molecules to excitatory versus inhibitory synapses (13, 79, 80). Indeed, a recent 
study has shown that neuroligins lacking insert at splice site B target more efficiently 
to inhibitory synapses, while those containing an insert at this splice site localize 
mainly to excitatory synapses. Thus, this splice code guides the specific binding of 
particular neuroligin and neurexin variants (39, 122). A 30-residue insert at splice 
2 and GABAA receptors in non-neuronal cells is sufficient for reconstitution of 
pression of CaMKII in neurons (131). Thus, synapses induced by neuroligins seem"

site 4 of β-neurexins reduces the affinity of interaction specifically with neuroligin-1 
that contains an insert at splice site B, and promotes GABAergic synapse develop-
ment. In contrast, the presence of an insert at site B of neuroligin-1, which is the 
predominantly expressed neuroligin-1 protein, promotes targeting to glutamatergic 
synapses (32). The basis for the binding affinity of alternatively spliced neuroligin 
for neurexins appears to be protein glycosylation. N-glycosylation at Asn 303 lo-
cated in splice site B containing insert hinders binding of neuroligin-1 to neurexin 
1β. In contrast, neuroligin-1 lacking the insert at splice site B binds both β- and α-
neurexins (13). These results suggest that differential combinations of neuroligin and 
neurexin isoforms at contact sites activate distinct signaling codes that specify par-
ticular synaptic properties. Whether the spatial and temporal expression of these 
splice variants control synapse specificity remains an open question. 
Intracellular binding partners of neuroligins and neurexins also influence the dif-
ferential targeting of specific neuroligin family members, which would direct the 
effects of a particular neuroligin to one synapse type over another. In addition to 
possessing PDZ-binding motifs, the C-termini of neuroligins show the highest degree 
of sequence divergence, and may therefore provide a basis for different family mem-
bers trafficking to distinct synapse types. For instance, coexpression of neuroligin-1 
or -2 with the excitatory scaffold protein, PSD-95, restricts the presynaptic-inducing 
effects of neuroligins to excitatory contacts (117, 143). By assembling a core com-
plex containing stargazin, AMPA receptors, and cell adhesion molecules, PSD-95 
and other scaffolding proteins found in the PSD may therefore determine excitatory 
synapse identity, whereas other unidentified adaptor proteins may control sorting and 
stabilization of cell adhesion molecules at inhibitory postsynaptic sites (16, 59). 
Other molecules that potentially contribute to differential retention of neuroligins 
at excitatory and inhibitory synapses include shank, GRIP, gephyrin and dystrogly-
can (39, 75, 115, 116, 122, 124). Shank is a PDZ protein enriched at glutamatergic 
synapses, and has been shown to influence spine morphology and presynaptic func-
tion (76, 145, 152, 153, 163). The GRIP proteins (GRIP1 and GRIP2, also known as 
ABP; AMPA receptor binding protein) represents another important family of scaf-
folding molecules, whose members contain up to seven PDZ domains and have been 
implicated in clustering of glutamate receptors (22, 28, 44, 49, 52, 87, 99, 120, 135, 
136). GRIP family members were initially identified by their association with the 
GluR2/GluR3 subunits of the AMPA receptor, which bind to the fourth and fifth 
PDZ domains of GRIP. Disruption of the GluR2-GRIP interaction inhibits accumula-
tion of AMPA receptors at the synapse. In addition, other studies have shown that 
GRIP is also present at inhibitory synapses. Thus, members of the GRIP family 
comprise another class of proteins potentially involved in sequestration of neu-
roligins to excitatory and inhibitory contacts. Gephyrin is a molecule concentrated 
within the postsynaptic domain of GABAergic synapses, that has been implicated in 
108, 114, 116). A direct interaction between gephyrin and neuroligins has not been 
assessed, and thus it remains a possibility that gephyrin directly influences neuroligin 
trafficking, or does so indirectly, through other factors that influence the function of 
neuroligins at inhibitory synapses. Another molecule enriched at inhibitory synapses is 
dystroglycan, a protein composed of an extracellular α subunit and a transmembrane 
clustering of GABAA receptor subunits in hippocampal neurons (19, 42, 65, 107,"
497,"===== Page 10 =====

β subunit. β-Dystroglycan binds dystrophin and utrophin intracellularly, while α-
dystroglycan binds several matrix molecules including agrin, laminin, and perlecan 
extracellularly (115). The binding of dystroglycan to neurexin makes it a good can-
didate for modulating the effects of neuroligin/neurexin on synapse development 
(172). Thus, interplay between these molecules influences assembly of neuroligins at 
both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. 
Mechanisms that control early sorting and delivery of individual neuroligin 
molecules to nascent neuronal contacts are less understood. To address this issue, we 
have monitored the mobility of neuroligin molecules at synaptic sites (Fig. 4). 
 
 
Fig. 4. Differential mobility of neuroligins at synaptic sites. (a) Fluorescence recovery after 
photobleaching anslysis shows rapid recovery of fluorescene intensity of neuroligin-1 clusters 
present at excitaory synpases (Shank1b-YFP-positive), suggesting the existence of a dynamic 
To detect cell surface receptors, a biotinylation-based approach that allows the 
visualization of surface proteins in live neurons was utilized (88). This analysis 
revealed that clusters of both neuroligin-1 and -2 show rapid changes in fluorescence 
intensity, suggesting continous remodeling of neuroligin clusters at the cell surface. 
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching anslysis shows similar recovery 
dynamics for GFP- (representative of the total pool) and AP-tagged (representative 
of the surface pool) neuroligins. This suggests that the accumulation of neuroligins at 
existing clusters involves the retention of a diffusible surface pool, rather than direct 
insertion from an intracellular pool. However, neuroligin-1 clusters exhibit faster 
of neuroligin-2 in more mature neurons. 
 
The renewal of neuroligin-1 clusters is also influenced by expression of PSD-95, 
which reduces the recovery time of neuroligin-1, indicating that PSD-95 interaction 
pool of neuroligin-1 at contact sites. Neuroligin-1 clusters exhibit faster recovery than those of 
neuroligin-2 at inhbitory (CFP-Gephyrin-positive) sites, revealing differential mobility and/or 
dynamics of recruitment of these proteins at synapses. (b) Renewal of neuroligin-1 clusters is

plays a role in stabilizing the diffusible pool of neuroligin-1 at the synapse. Consis-
tent with these findings, PSD-95 enhances recruitment of endogenous neuroligin-1 to 
excitatory contacts, and this process correlates with an increase in the size of pre-
synaptic terminals (143). Recent data also show that the assembly of a complex of 
scaffold proteins containing neuroligin-1 may precede the recruitment of presynaptic 
vesicle proteins and the machinery required for active recycling of neurotransmitter. 
In this case, the presence of postsynaptic proteins such as neuroligins may facilitate 
recruitment of presynaptic molecules important for vesicular release (76). Previous 
studies, however, demonstrated that recruitment of PSD-95 can also occur after the 
establishment of an active presynaptic terminal (1, 17, 69). Although the role of 
adhesion complexes was not examined in these studies, the presumed role of neu-
roligin would be to recruit PSD-95 to these sites. Another study looking at nascent 
contacts made by axonal filopodia highlighted the rapid recruitment of NMDA-type 
glutamate receptors independently of PSD-95, before the establishment of an active 
presynaptic terminal (190). Thus, it will be important to distinguish between traffick-
ing of newly synthesized neuroligin molecules and retention of pre-existing protein 
at the cell surface and synaptic sites. Perhaps the role of PSD-95 relates more to the 
former at earlier stages of synaptic development during the assembly of postsynaptic 
proteins. At mature synapses, PSD-95 may restrict the mobility of neuroligins at the 
synapse and thus modulate their retention at particular contact sites. 
Less is known about binding partners that influence neurexin targeting and func-
tion at presynaptic sites. The interaction between α-neurexins and neurexophilins, a 
family of secreted glycoproteins, has been suggested to mediate cell signaling (126, 
140). Another extracellular ligand of both α- and β-neurexins is dystroglycan (172). 
Although the functional relevance of this interaction is uncertain, it has been sug-
gested that it may regulate cell adhesion at inhibitory contacts. Intracellularly, neur-
exins are coupled to CASK, which forms a stoichiometric complex with Mint-1 (also 
called X11 or Lin-10) and Velis (also called MALS or Lin-7) potentially involved in 
organizing presynaptic vesicle release machinery (5, 23). In CASK-deficient neu-
rons, glutamatergic spontaneous synaptic release events are increased, and GABAer-
gic synaptic release events are decreased, indicating that coupling of neurexins to 
these scaffolding molecules may modulate presynaptic release. 
2.5 Other Mechanisms that Regulate Neuroligin/Neurexin Assembly  
and Function 
Other mechanisms that control neuroligin/neurexin interaction and function include 
calcium binding, glycosylation, and oligomerization (13, 32, 34, 35, 90, 181). Neu-
roligin/β-neurexin binding requires only low Ca2+ concentrations, and thus under 
physiological conditions, changes in Ca2+ levels at the synaptic cleft following syn-
aptic activation may not influence association of these molecules at the synapse. 
Neuronal depolarization, however, may modulate splicing of specific isoforms of α-
neurexins, particularly at splice sites 1 and 3 (146). Another mechanism that poten-
tially modulates the function of neuroligins is protein oligomerization. Neuroligin-1 
mutants which fail to cluster neurexins and induce presynaptic differentiation also 
show disrupted formation of neuroligin-1 homo-oligomers (47). These results high-"

light the functional importance of neuroligin oligomerization with respect to its abil-
ity to signal to the presynaptic side. It is possible that intermolecular binding occurs 
between different neuroligin family members, resulting in the formation of neu-
roligin hetero-oligomers. This may have implications in modulating neuroligin-
directed recruitment of specific molecules at the synapse. 
Recent evidence shows that postsynaptically localized β-neurexin inhibits trans-
binding of neuroligin-1 to presynaptic neurexins, blocking synaptogenic activity 
(177). These results suggest that postsynaptic interactions between neuroligins and 
neurexins provide a mechanism for silencing the activity of this adhesion complex. 
This finding presents yet further insight into mechanisms potentially involved in 
modulating excitation and inhibition via neuroligin-neurexin interaction. Other stud-
ies showed that retrograde signaling through the neuroligin/neurexin protein complex 
modulates the release probability of synaptic transmitter vesicles due to alterations in 
presynaptic short-term plasticity (72). 
2.6 In Vivo Assessment of the Function of Neurexins and Neuroligins 
neurexins in Ca2+-regulated neurotransmitter release, potentially through coupling N- 
and P/Q-type calcium channels to the presynaptic exocytotic machinery (54, 55, 125, 
128, 167, 200). Mice lacking all three α-neurexins show reduced neurotransmitter 
release at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and die at early postnatal stages. How-
ever, no gross anatomical defects or changes in the distribution of synaptic proteins 
or axonal projections were observed. Structural alterations observed include a 20% 
reduction of neuropil area in many brain regions, due to shortened distal dendritic 
branches and fewer spines. A moderate decrease (30%) in inhibitory synapse number 
in the neocortex was also observed, indicating that neurexin function is likely more 
critical for inhibitory synapse maturation. Overall, these studies illustrate that α-
neurexins are not essential for the formation of the majority of synapses in vivo. 
However, it is possible that the expression of β-neurexins or other adhesion systems 
may have compensated for the loss of α-neurexins in these mice. In contrast, studies 
on flies mutant for α-neurexin show that this adhesion molecule is required for syn-
apse formation and associative learning (199). Neurexin-1 mutant flies are viable and 
fertile, but exhibit a decrease in synapse number and have shortened lifespan. Similar 
investigations on mice lacking neuroligins show that neuroligins are essential for 
survival but not for CNS synapse formation (184). Despite a significant reduction in 
the expression of many presynaptic proteins, there were no obvious changes in syn-
apse number or morphology in many brain areas examined. Interestingly, mice lack-
ing neuroligins 1–3 die shortly after birth due to respiratory failure (184). In these 
mutant animals, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission is impaired in the 
brainstem respiratory center. A shift in the balance between excitation and inhibition 
most likely accounts for the defects in the respiratory control system, indicating that 
neuroligins and neurexins are not necessary for synapse induction, but rather for 
survival and for the regulation of specific aspects of synapse maturation that control 
synaptic strength, signaling and function. Together, the current data indicate that 
neuroligins and neurexins may take part in multiple molecular interactions to regu-

late a host of neuronal processes, ranging from synapse maturation to neurotransmit-
ter exocytosis and cellular signaling (Fig. 5). Future studies are required to further 
elucidate the mechanisms that control their action at the synapse. 
 
 
Fig. 5. Potential functions mediated by the neuroligin/neurexin adhesion complex. Putative 
functions proposed for the neuroligin/neurexin complex. A combination of specific isoforms 
of neuroligins and neurexins may allow the recognition of a particular type of neuron or even a 
specific location on a target neuron, thus determining the type of synaptic contact formed (e.g. 
excitatory versus inhibitory; left panel). After contact formation between pre- and postsynaptic 
neurons, recruitment of neuroligin and neurexin may trigger coordinated recruitment of pre-
synaptic protein packets and postsynaptic scaffold complexes to control synapse stabilization 
and maturation (middle panel). The recruitment and/or stabilization of the neuroligin/neurexin 
complex at mature synapses may also influence synaptic strength. Enhanced association of 
neuroligin/neurexin by increased protein delivery to/retention at the synapse will strengthen 
trans-synaptic signaling (right panel). In contrast, uncoupling of the neuroligin/neurexin com-
plex may result in reduced synaptic strength. 
2.7 Potential Link to Neurodevelopmental Disorders 
Recent studies indicate that altered synapse formation and maturation is the leading 
cause of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia (202). 
Defects in spine maturation have been implicated in many forms of mental retarda-
tion and memory impairment. Autism and Asperger syndrome are classified as per-
vasive developmental disorders, also referred to as autism-spectrum disorders 
(ASD). These syndromes are characterized by varying degrees of abnormality in 
communication ability and social interactions, as well as repetitive and stereotyped 
patterns of behavior. A number of twin and other family studies have supported a 
strong genetic component in autism. Although intensive genetic research in recent 
years has identified a number of genes that may be involved in the pathology of 
autism, the biological mechanisms underlying neurological deficits remain poorly 
understood. It has been hypothesized that the behavioral and cognitive deficits found 
in autistic patients may result from alterations in neuronal circuitry implicated in 
sensory, mnemonic, social and emotional information processing. Neuroimaging and 
neuropathological studies of these circuits in autistic patients have provided impor-
tant insights into the etiology of autism, leading to a model that could explain the"

observed dysfunctions. This model postulates that an increase in the ratio of excita-
tion/inhibition in neural circuits involved in information processing may underlie the 
dysfunctions characteristic of autism (147). Considering the role of neuroligins in 
controlling the function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, these proteins are 
good candidate genes for being affected in these disorders. Indeed, rearrangement of 
chromosomal regions harboring neuroligin-1, -2 and PSD-95 genes have been asso-
ciated with autism (6, 111, 202). Two mutations in the X-chromosomal neuroligin 
genes, neuroligin-3 and -4, have also been linked to some forms of autism, including 
Asperger syndrome (94). The associated mutation in neuroligin-3 consisted of a 
substitution of Arg451 for Cys (R451C), resulting in a missense mutation. In the case 
of neuroligin-4, a novel insertion at position 396 (D396X) resulted in a frame shift 
and premature termination of the transcript. Support for the involvement of neu-
roligin-4 in autism was provided by another genetic study of a large French family 
with members affected by non-specific X-linked mental retardation with or without 
autism or pervasive developmental disorders. In the latter study, another frame-shift 
mutation in neuroligin-4 was identified (113). In this case, a 2-base-pair deletion was 
found to generate a stop codon in the middle of the protein, leading to the formation 
of a truncated protein lacking sequences crucial for neuroligin dimerization required 
for binding to β-neurexins, as well as the transmembrane and intracellular domains. 
The fact that this mutation was found in both autistic and non-autistic mentally re-
tarded patients indicates that neuroligin-4 may be implicated in both autism and 
mental retardation. Since neuroligin-associated disorders seem to include both au-
tism and mental retardation, it suggests these two syndromes may share a common 
synaptically modulated mechanism (63). 
Recent linkage and copy number variation analyses also implicate chromosome 
11p12–p13 and neurexins, respectively, among other candidate associated with 
3 Synapse Induction by Members of the IgG Superfamily 
Similar to neuroligins, SynCAM1 (Synaptic Cell Adhesion Molecule) has been 
shown to promote presynaptic differentiation at contacts between axons and het-
erologous cells, and to drive the recruitment of synaptic proteins at sites of contact 
(10, 47, 157). SynCAM1 is localized to both sides of the synaptic cleft and shares 
similarities with the invertebrate molecules fascicilin II and apCAM. SynCAM1 is a 
SynCAM1 contain 3 Ig-domains, and a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif which medi-
ates interactions with the synaptic scaffolding proteins CASK and syntenin. Loss-of-
function studies indicate that PDZ domain containing adaptor proteins are involved 
autism (175). In addition to neuroligins and neurexins, mutations in the adhesion 
molecule NrCam (151) and the scaffolding protein Shank3 (56) have been linked to 
autism. Dysfunction in adhesion molecule expression appears to be a common defect 
in language and/or social communication disorders.

in this process. There are three other genes encoding SynCAM, and heterophilic 
adhesion between the various SynCAM isoforms has been demonstrated (164). 
However, the function of other SynCAM isoforms and the consequences of hetero-
philic binding between them have not been studied in neurons. At the presynaptic 
terminal, the known protein interaction motifs in the cytosolic tails of SynCAM1 and 
β-neurexins are highly conserved. They therefore presumably bind the same adaptor 
proteins. Although SynCAMs and neuroligins are strong inducers of synapses, it 
appears that synapses induced by these adhesion molecules are functionally distinct 
(156). The artificial presynaptic terminals induced by these molecules on heterolo-
gous cells are identical in all parameters measured, and to true synapses. Overex-
pression in neurons however, produced different effects. SynCAM1 specifically 
promotes excitatory synaptic transmission. Moreover, only expression of SynCAM1 
increased synaptic function by electrophysiological measures, whereas morphologi-
cal analysis revealed the opposite, only neuroligin increased synapse number (156). 
In contrast, other studies have used electrophysiology to show increased synaptic 
function in neuroligin overexpressing neurons (117, 143), and that knockdown of 
neuroligin diminishes synaptic function and activity (30). The differences between 
these observations may be explained by variations in levels of protein overexpression 
3.2 NGLs and SALMS 
Neuronal proteins containing leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), such as the Nogo-66 re-
ceptor, Slit, AMIGO, LINGO, NGL, and NLRR, have been implicated in neurite 
outgrowth and cell migration (102, 109). However, recent studies revealed that par-
ticular members of LRR containing proteins regulate synaptogenesis. Examples 
include the netrin G ligands (NGLs) and synaptic adhesion-like molecules (SALMs), 
molecules that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins (109, 110, 
189). NGLs and SALMs have similar domain structure and share the ability to bind 
at higher levels in postnatal brains than in embryonic tissue, supporting an important 
role for NGLs in synapse development. Recent studies have shown that NGL2, ex-
pressed in nonneuronal cells, induces the formation of functional presynaptic termi-
nals in contacting axons of co-cultured neurons. Moreover, overexpression of NGL2 
in neurons increases the number of excitatory synapses and clustering of postsynap-
tic proteins such as PSD-95 and NMDA receptors. These results suggest that NGL2 
modulates excitatory synapse development through its association with PSD-95. The 
SALM family includes five members, each contain six LRRs, an Ig domain, and a 
fibronectin III domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal PDZ-
binding motif. When overexpressed in neurons, SALMs promote neurite outgrowth,  
 
and neuronal culture preparation. Despite the fact that SynCAM and neuroligin are 
potent synapse inducers in vitro, neither has been shown to be absolutely required for 
synapse induction in vivo. Mice lacking SynCAM1 are viable and do not exhibit 
major synapse abnormalities. It remains unclear whether synaptogenesis in mice 
lacking SynCAM1 is not altered due to functional compensation by other members 
of the SynCAM family (71).

excitatory synapse maturation and clustering of NMDA receptors. However, unlike 
NGLs, SALMs expression in non-neuronal cells is not sufficient for synapse induc-
tion. 
4 Other Adhesion Molecules Involved in Synapse Maturation 
4.1 Cadherins, Catenins, and Protocadherins 
Members of cadherins and protocadherins have been implicated in controlling spe-
cific stages of synaptogenesis that involve target recognition. Due to their wide ex-
pression in the brain and the existence of multiple isoforms, matching cadherins in 
axons and dendrites is believed to promote selective adhesion between appropriate 
partners. All three major subtypes of cadherins are expressed in the brain: classical 
cadherins, cadherin-related proteins, and protocadherins. The expression and subcel-
lular distribution of classical cadherins, and their intracellular binding partners, cat-
enins, varies with neuronal type and developmental stage. This distinct distribution 
of each of these adhesive molecules potentially provides the molecular basis for 
specificity of synapse connectivity (161). 
At individual synapses, classical cadherins are detected at pre- and postsynaptic 
sites (9, 95, 178). In development, N-cadherin and β-catenin are localized diffusely 
in motile dendritic filopodia. Upon contact with an axon, the cadherin complex ac-
cumulates at the tip of filopodia at points of contact (95, 178). Cadherins signal via 
catenins to regulate dendritic spine morphology and motility. In addition, in vivo 
studies revealed that the loss of particular catenin molecules results in abnormal 
synapse formation and/or maturation. Studies using a dominant negative approach 
(N-cadherin lacking ectodomain), demonstrates that blockade of N-cadherin function 
results in a conversion of mature spines to filopodia-like spines and loss of β-catenin 
(178). These effects are more dramatic in younger neurons, further emphasizing the 
The cadherin complex mediates profound changes in the actin cytoskeleton 
through several effectors including cortactin, Arp1/3, formin-1, and the Rho family 
of GTPases (27, 85). Several adhesion complexes have been shown to affect spine 
importance of cadherins at early stages of synaptogenesis. Interfering with cadherin 
function suggests that these molecules are more likely involved in the regulation of 
target specificity, rather than induction. For example, initial synaptic assembly is 
delayed, but not blocked, in neurons that are transfected with dominant-negative 
cadherin (15). Studies in the retinotectal system show that the addition of antibodies 
that block N-cadherin function causes retinal ganglion cells to overshoot their target 
and form exuberant synapses (92). Thus, evidence indicates that cadherins are 
important for target recognition, but they are not essential for synapse differentiation. 
Blocking N-cadherin adhesion causes the formation of widely separated synaptic 
clefts in the chick retinotectal tract (196). Mislocalization of β-catenin, through 
disruption of its interaction with cadherin, alters synapsin and PSD-95 localization 
and affects presynaptic vesicle release (7, 130). Thus, the recruitment of the 
cadherin-catenin complex appears to modulate maturation of pre- and postsynaptic 
sites."

morphology or the actin cytoskeleton, including neuroligins, cadherins, integrins, 
syndecans, and numerous members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (61). Also, 
interaction between adhesion molecules with the extracellular matrix is believed to 
regulate spine maturation. Two integrin ligands have been demonstrated to affect 
dendritic spines: laminin increases spine density, whereas reelin promotes spine 
stability (61). In addition, the transmembrane proteoglycan syndecan has been shown 
to induce early transformation of filopodia protrusions into mature mushroom-
shaped spines (60). 
The large sequence diversity of protocadherins has also led to the suggestion of 
their role in target selection and specifying neuronal circuits. About 70 protocadher-
ins are known in mouse and human, and many of these are expressed in the nervous 
system in largely overlapping patterns, with some regional and cell-type differences 
in strength of expression (67, 68). Further analysis revealed that protocadherin-γ 
lacking neurons form significantly fewer synapses than wild type neurons (192). 
Correlating expression pattern of certain protocadherin isoforms, to neuronal subsets 
for which the pattern of connectivity is known, may help us determine how synapse 
specificity is controlled. 
4.2 Sidekick 
The expression pattern and the consequences of its mis-expression on connectivity 
have also been demonstrated for the adhesion molecule sidekick. Sidekick is a mem-
ber of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins and contains 6 Ig domains and 13 
fibronectin III repeats. Sidekick was identified based on its ability to regulate photo-
trate at pre- and postsynaptic sites respectively, in non-overlapping subsets of retinal 
neurons (198). Cells expressing sidekick-1 and -2 form separate aggregates. Deletion 
of the domains required for homophilic association abolishes adhesion. Moreover, 
the generation of chimeras reverses adhesion specificity (84). Since sidekick is en-
riched at synapses in narrow sub-laminae of the inner plexiform layer, this suggests 
4.3 Ephrins and Ephrin Receptors 
Ephrin receptors (Eph’s) are a large family of 14 receptors and 8 ligands known as 
ephrins. Eph receptors and ephrin ligands are expressed through out the developing 
and mature nervous system and were initially characterized based on their ability to 
guide axons to their proper targets, and later determined to be present at synapses 
(20, 66, 179). Eph receptors are divided into two classes: EphA and EphB, which 
bind ephrin A and ephrin B respectively. Ephrins must be clustered to bind and acti-
vate their cognate receptor (43). EphB receptor tyrosine kinases have been shown to 
regulate excitatory synaptogenesis, including the clustering of NMDARs and AM-
PARs, dendritic spine formation, and presynaptic differentiation (60, 97). EphB-
mediated signaling seems to be particularly significant for a subset of synaptic inputs 
in vivo (61).

that sidekick-mediated adhesion may promote laminae specific connectivity."

4.4 NCAM and L1-CAM 
The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) has been shown to regulate synapse 
maturation through homo- and heterophilic interactions with recognition molecules 
(21, 40, 48, 50, 51, 133, 149, 160, 171, 174, 183). In particular, NCAM is thought to 
regulate the early events that control contact formation, and fasciculation of axons to 
form bundles, such as the retinotectal and mossy fiber projections (40, 149). NCAM 
is encoded by a single gene located on chromosome 11, and as a result of alternative 
splicing, is synthesized in three main membrane-bound isoforms (NCAM-120, 
NCAM-140, and NCAM-180) which differ in their C-terminals. NCAM-180 and -
140 are transmembrane proteins, with different length intracellular domains, whereas 
NCAM-120 is attached to the membrane by a glycosylphosphalitdylinositol (GPI) 
anchor. All three isoforms have a conserved extracellular domain consisting of 5 Ig 
domains followed by 2 fibronectin type III repeats. All three isoforms of NCAM can 
be released from primary hippocampal neurons in culture (89). The significance of 
proteolytic processing of membrane-bound NCAM is not well known, however, 
soluble NCAM forms have been implicated in synaptic plasticity, including long-
term potentiation (LTP) (62, 101). Live imaging studies have shown that NCAM 
translocates to contact sites within minutes after initial contact formation (174). 
Thus, NCAM is potentially involved in early synaptogenesis and in synaptic matura-
tion. At later stages, the relative levels of post-, but not presynaptic, NCAM expres-
sion regulates the strength of excitatory synapses in a NMDA receptor-dependent 
manner (50). This mechanism involves the interaction between the polysialylated 
form of NCAM and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and requires fibroblast growth 
factor receptor (FGFR)-mediated signaling. The importance of mammalian NCAM 
for synapse dynamics is further supported by activity-dependent expression of 
NCAM (159) and impaired LTP in mice deficient in NCAM (21, 57, 129). 
The repertoire of molecules that influence synapse induction and maturation is 
involved in glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse development. A survey of 22 
cadherin family members demonstrated distinct roles for cadherin-11 and cadherin-
13 in synapse development. This screen also revealed roles for the class 4 Sema-
phorins, Sema4B and Sema4D, in the development of glutamatergic and GABAergic 
synapses. Sema4D influences GABAergic, but not glutamatergic synapse develop-
ment. These experiments identify new components that influence the genetic pro-
gram that regulate synapse formation and/or maintenance. 
L1-CAMs are expressed by almost all post-mitotic neurons in the CNS at the onset 
of differentiation, but not by glia. During development L1-CAM has been shown to 
regulate neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, fasciculation and guidance, survival, 
and myelination, and some of their roles in the CNS, particularly at synapses, have 
recently been elucidated. Synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices from adult constitu-
tively L1-deficient mice do not have significant changes in LTP induced by theta-burst 
or high frequency stimulation in the CA1 region (11). These findings were re-
capitulated in juvenile mice, but interestingly, perisomatic inhibition was noticeably 
impaired, with a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of inhibitory postsynaptic 
currents, as well as a decrease in the number of inhibitory synapses (150).

5 Adhesion Molecules Involved in Inhibitory Synapse 
Development 
A role for neuroligins and protocadherins in inhibitory synapse maturation and func-
in inhibitory synaptogenesis including dystroglycan, L1, and N-CAM. Dystroglycan 
was the first identified adhesive macromolecule at mature GABA synapses, cluster-
115). Dystroglycan is composed of an extracellular α-subunit and a transmembrane 
β-subunit derived from proteolytic cleavage and glycosylation of a single precursor 
protein, and binds several extracellular matrix molecules such as agrin, laminin and 
perlecan. In addition, dystroglycan binds to the intracellular proteins, dystrophin and 
utrophin (193). Importantly, dystroglycan also binds to two cell surface proteins 
involved in synaptogenesis, namely agrin and β-neurexin (172, 173). Despite the 
potential of dystroglycan as an inhibitory synaptic adhesion protein, studies on neu-
rons obtained from mice mutant for dystroglycan indicate that this protein is not 
essential, since clustering of many proteins that localize to inhibitory synapses is not 
affected in these mice (115). These findings suggest that dystroglycans may play a 
more prominent role in the maturation of inhibitory contacts. 
A clue for one of the functions of L1-CAM in inhibitory synapse development 
comes from a study on a member of the family known as neurofascin186 (3). The 
precise localization of neurofascin186 by the membrane adaptor protein ankyrin G is 
responsible for establishment of a gradient of this adhesion molecule at the initial 
axon segment of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Disruption of this gradient results in dis-
ruption of the subcellular localization of GABAergic synapses on the axonal initial 
segment (3). These data suggest that L1 may be important in directing formation of 
inhibitory synapses to specific sites on the target neurons. Protocadherins also appear 
to be important for inhibitory synapse development in the spinal cord. Spinal cord 
neurons prepared from protocadherin mutant mice show a decrease in the number of 
GABAergic terminals. Moreover, electrophysiological recordings revealed a de-
crease in both spontaneous and evoked inhibitory currents (192). Whether protocad-
herins are important for inhibitory synapse development in other areas of the brain 
remains to be explored. 
6 Role for Adhesion Molecules in Synaptic Plasticity 
Expression of many adhesion molecules persists into adulthood, and as such, these 
molecules are thought to play a role in the activity-dependent remodeling of synaptic 
contacts, a process associated with learning and memory paradigms. The expression 
level of several adhesion molecules that participate in the modification of existing 
synapses is also regulated by neuronal activity. For instance, N-cadherin, NCAM and 
promoter for NCAM is sensitive to AMPA receptor activity (86). Functional block-
ing approaches and gene knockouts also support a role for several families of cell 
tion has been established (75). A few other adhesion molecules have been implicated 
ing at synaptic loci after synaptic vesicles, GABAA receptors, and gephyrin (108,

adhesion molecules, including integrins, cadherins, ephrins and NCAM, in the 
modulation of synaptic plasticity and animal behavior. 
Integrins potentially play multiple roles in adhesion, signal transduction and cy-
toskeletal organization (58, 134, 142). Blocking integrin function in the adult rat 
hippocampus with an RGD sequence peptide, which interferes with integrin binding 
to its endogenous ligands in the extracellular matrix, causes a decay of LTP, an en-
during enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission (170, 195). Furthermore, 
chronic blockade by RGD peptides or by functional antibodies against the β3 in-
tegrin subunit prevents activity-dependent reduction in the probability of glutamate 
release (29). Members of the Ig superfamily, in particular NCAM and L1, also con-
trol synaptic plasticity. Antibodies against L1 or NCAM infused into the hippocam-
pus of rats decreases efficiency of spatial learning tasks such as the Morris water 
maze (4). L1 knockout mice show similar learning impairments (96). In vitro, L1 
antibodies and soluble oligomannosides that disrupt interaction with NCAM, signifi-
cantly reduce LTP induced by theta-burst stimulation (123). 
Several adhesion complexes regulate retrograde signaling between pre- and 
postsynaptic compartments. The EphB-ephrinB receptor-ligand pair is of particular 
interest due to its capacity for bidirectional signaling (66), which is thought to coor-
dinate changes in both sides of the synapse during LTP. On the postsynaptic mem-
brane, addition of ephrinB induces interaction between EphB and NMDA-type glu-
tamate receptors, an increase in NMDA-mediated calcium influx and gene 
expression (41, 176). Disruption of Eph/ephrin signaling by interfering peptides 
inhibits retrograde signaling through ephrinB, blocking LTP at mossy fibers in the 
cerebellum (37). Thus, multiple adhesion systems exist to modulate communication 
7 Conclusions and Future Directions 
Numerous studies indicate that several of the recently identified adhesion molecules 
can modulate synaptic contact number, morphology and function. However, strong 
evidence that any of these molecules are indispensable for synapse formation in vivo 
is lacking, suggesting functional redundancy. Thus, one can envisage that synapse 
formation and maturation rely on the collective action of these adhesive systems. 
Most likely, crosstalk between the different adhesive systems ensures proper connec-
tivity and recruitment of appropriate neurotransmitter receptors and associated pro-
tein complexes. Whether these adhesion molecules act in parallel or in a hierarchical 
manner remains unknown. Future studies are needed to determine how these various 
adhesion systems orchestrate the establishment and function of synapses. Time-lapse 
imaging studies monitoring the behavior of several molecules implicated in synapse 
development will help address some of these issues. Moreover, future in vivo ex-
between pre- and postsynaptic cells to induce long lasting changes in synaptic effi-
cacy. Both LTP and LTD have been reported at inhibitory synapses in a variety of 
brain regions, including the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum and brain stem (24, 25, 
73, 81). However, it remains to be determined whether changes in plasticity of in-
hibitory synapses are controlled by similar mechanisms that involve retrograde sig-
naling through adhesive complexes."

Dendritic Organelles for Postsynaptic Trafficking

Abstract. The development, maintenance, and plasticity of synapses require the trafficking of 
molecular components to postsynaptic specializations distributed across elaborate dendritic 
arbors. The large size and geometric complexity of dendrites necessitate specialized mecha-
nisms that can both deliver postsynaptic cargo over extended distances and regulate dendritic 
composition on a submicron scale. Despite the fundamental importance of membrane traffick-
ing in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity, the cellular rules governing postsynaptic 
trafficking are only now emerging. We review here current knowledge on the organization of 
dendritic organelles, and describe cell biological mechanisms that allow long-range transport 
of postsynaptic components that are then locally processed at individual synapses. 
1 Introduction 
While inhibitory synapses are typically localized on the dendritic shaft (190), 
most excitatory synapses in the brain are localized on micron-sized membranous 
protrusions present along the entire length of dendrites (85). These dendritic spines 
contact one or more presynaptic terminals, and the sites of contact contain a dense 
array of receptors, scaffold proteins, and signaling molecules at the postsynaptic 
density (PSD) (96). The molecular content of dendritic branches, individual spines, and 
the PSD is subject to rapid and long-lasting modification based on developmental stage 
and patterns of neural activity (45, 122, 290). This multi-layered compartmental 
organization requires long-range transport of postsynaptic proteins to reach the most 
With long and highly branched processes extending up to several hundred microns 
from the cell body, neurons have surface areas up to 10,000 times greater than typi-
cal mammalian cells and display a remarkable degree of locally specified physio-
logical properties (106). These spatially restricted properties (e.g. action potential 
generation and neurotransmitter release in the axon, postsynaptic response to neuro-
transmitters in dendrites, synapse-specific modification for long-lasting plasticity) 
are due to a high degree of molecular compartmentalization, the basis for which is 
only now emerging.

In addition to a role as a Ca2+ reservoir important for postsynaptic signaling 
(236), spine SER may also be involved in lipid and protein secretion to the spine 
surface. A specialized SER-like derivative composed of stacked cisternae, termed the 
spine apparatus, is found in some dendritic spines (Fig. 2a) (84–86, 268). The pres-
ence of vesicles near the tip of the spine apparatus raises the possibility that it could 
supply membrane for spine growth, and possibly traffic important synaptic proteins, 
such as AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors, which can be localized to this or-
ganelle (200, 227, 268). Though defined largely on morphological criteria, the pre-
cise compartmental identity of the spine apparatus has yet to be determined. Notably, 
the spine apparatus is absent in mice lacking synaptopodin (55). These mice display 
deficits in LTP and spatial learning, indicating a potential link between the spine 
apparatus and mechanisms of synaptic plasticity (55). 
The organization of the GA in neurons is quite different from what is observed in 
most non-neuronal cells. Immunofluorescence labeling shows that the neuronal GA 
consists not only of the perinuclear membrane array found in most cell types, but 
also of discrete structures dispersed in dendrites, termed Golgi outposts (Fig. 2b) (52, 
75, 105, 108, 168, 285). This organization has been confirmed by EM, where minia-
ture Golgi-stacks and intracellular membranes immuno-reactive for Golgi mem-
branes markers such as α-mannosidase II, giantin, GM130, and Rab6, have been 
observed in dendrites (75, 108, 220). Dendritic Golgi membranes can be found close 
to synapses but seem to be only localized to the dendritic shaft. Moreover, not all 
dendrites contain morphological or molecular markers of the GA (108), suggesting 
dendrite-specific compartmentalization of secretory trafficking. 
The dendritic localization of RER, ERES and Golgi membranes suggests that 
“satellite” secretory systems exist in some dendrites that could locally synthesize and 
process secretory proteins at sites remote from the cell body. Numerous mRNA 
species are found in dendrites, including mRNAs encoding postsynaptic receptors 
such as NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors and glycine receptors (272). Although 
the local translation of membrane proteins in dendrites is still not as clearly deline-
ated as that of cytoplasmic proteins, protein synthesis and enzymatic activities asso-
ciated with the secretory pathway, such as glycosylation, persist in hippocampal 
dendrites isolated from the soma (284, 285). The capacity of isolated dendrites to 
In addition to its function in lipid biogenesis (21), the SER plays a crucial role in 
neuronal calcium homeostasis. The SER sequesters calcium by the action of the ER-
associated Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and releases it in the cytoplasm upon activation of 
inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) or ryanodine receptors (236, 240). The den-
dritic SER often extends into the neck of mature spines, providing a conduit to the 
synapse (Fig. 2a). 
Spine SER membranes occasionally extend to the periphery of the PSD (288). 
This tight association of intracellular calcium stores and the PSD may depend on the 
direct binding of inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) in the ER to the postsynap-
tic scaffold molecule Homer (242). SER membranes are absent from Purkinje neuron 
spines in dilute mice, which lack functional myosin Va (276). Parallel fiber synapses 
onto Purkine neurons in dilute mice have impaired long-term depression, supporting 
a requirement of spine SER calcium in cerebellar LTD (188)."

The involvement of dendritic Golgi ouposts in post-ER membrane trafficking 
was recently established by imaging hippocampal neurons expressing the ts045 
thermosensitive mutant of the vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein (VSVG-ts) 
(105). VSVG-ts is retained in the ER at 39.5°C, but is rapidly released by reducing 
the temperature to 32°C, allowing control and monitoring of the synchronous pro-
gression of cargo through the secretory pathway (16). Upon release from the ER, a 
fraction of pre-Golgi carriers containing VSVG-ts merge with dendritic compart-
ments immunoreactive for the Golgi markers galactosyltransferase and GM130, 
demonstrating that dendritic Golgi outposts are functional trafficking platforms 
(105). Golgi outposts also engage in the local dendritic trafficking of BDNF, con-
firming their role in processing endogenous proteins (105). The neural cell adhesion 
molecule (NCAM) promotes the accumulation of TGN-derived vesicles at neuron 
contact sites (275), indicating that post-Golgi compartments can be directed by inter-
cellular signaling. 
Although dendritic Golgi outposts are present in some dendrites of hippocampal 
and cortical neurons, not all neurons possess detectable dendritic Golgi membranes 
(105, 108). Moreover, even in those dendrites containing Golgi outposts, the major-
ity of ER-to-Golgi carriers originating in the dendrite are trafficked all the way back 
to the somatic Golgi in the cell body (105). Thus, dual modes of early secretory 
trafficking exist in dendrites. The major mode of ER-to-Golgi trafficking is directed 
long distances to the somatic Golgi apparatus and likely represents the exclusive 
mode of early secretory trafficking in those dendrites lacking Golgi outposts. A sec-
ond mode of ER-to-Golgi trafficking occurs locally in dendrites containing Golgi 
outposts, and may be specialized for the processing of specific cargo or the control of 
dendritic secretion. 
2.2 Dendritic Endosomes 
Spines or dendritic segments need to regulate the surface expression of neurotrans-
mitter receptors, adhesion molecules, and ion channels. Often separated by only a 
few microns, adjacent spines on a dendrite can have strikingly different steady-state 
levels of synaptic proteins (13, 64, 95, 183), requiring different rates of insertion, 
removal, and subsequent recycling. The endosomal system provides a primary 
mechanism for highly localized regulation of spine membrane composition. 
The endosomal system is an interconnected and dynamic network of membrane 
bound structures that receive endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). 
Newly internalized vesicles formed by means of clathrin-dependent or clathrin-
independent endocytosis fuse to form early/sorting endosomes (185). In much the 
synthesize exogenously expressed integral membrane proteins (e.g., glutamate recep-
tors) and deliver them to the plasma membrane has been reported (127, 128). 
Interestingly, at 20°C, a temperature which blocks vesicle budding from the TGN 
(181), newly released VSVG-ts frequently accumulates at Golgi outposts located at 
dendritic branch points (Fig. 2b) (105). These outposts engage in ongoing post-Golgi 
trafficking after release from TGN-exit blockade (105), and appear ideally positioned 
to regulate the identity or quantity of cargo that is trafficked to each branch, a possi-
bility that awaits further investigation."

C. Hanus and M.D. Ehlers 
The observation of an intracellular accumulation of various plasma proteins in 
Purkinje neuron dendrites was some of the first evidence for dendritic endocytosis 
(72). As shown by immunofluorescent labeling of a broad cast of endosome associ-
ated proteins, virtually all elements of the endosomal network are present in hippo-
campal neurons dendrites, including early endosomes, recycling endosomes, late 
endosomes, and lysosomes (17, 63), although spatial variations in endosome abun-
dance in different dendrites or different neuronal classes has not been thoroughly 
investigated. 
By combining three-dimensional electron microscopy reconstruction of dendrites 
in vivo with the tracking of internalized gold-conjugated endocytic cargo in acute 
hippocampal slices, Harris and colleagues have provided important insight into the 
fundamental organization of the dendritic endosomal network (47). Internal en-
dosomal structures are present in dendrites, including coated and uncoated vesicles, 
tubular structures and multi-vesicular bodies (Fig. 3a) (47). Interestingly, nearly two 
thirds of dendritic endosomal structures are situated within or at the base of spines 
(213), suggesting a direct involvement in subsynaptic membrane trafficking. En-
dosome-like structures generally extend over stretches of dendrite encompassing one 
to three spines, suggesting that multiple spines share the same endocytic organelles 
(47). Clathrin-like coats are present at the tip of some tubular protrusions emerging 
from these structures, indicating that they may generate smaller trafficking interme-
diates within the dendritic endosomal pathway (47). 
Other studies showed that syntaxin 13, a SNARE protein enriched in early and 
recycling endosomes, is found in dendritic tubulo-vesicular structures containing 
transferrin receptors, which are known to be recycled through the endosomal path-
way (225). Consistent with local endosomal trafficking, the transferrin receptor con-
tinuously cycles back and forth between the dendritic surface and internal structures 
 
same way that the TGN functions for secretory proteins, sorting endosomes act as a 
station from which internalized cargo can be targeted for degradation, transport to 
the TGN, or recycling back to the cell surface, either directly or via recycling en-
dosomes (Fig. 1) (19). Sorting endosomes display a characteristic tubulo-vesicular 
morphology directly related to their function. Molecules destined for reinsertion into 
the plasma membrane or to the TGN exit the sorting endosome on vesicles pinched 
off from small-diameter tubules (19). Cargo targeted for degradation remains in 
sorting endosomes which become progressively more acidic as they mature into late 
endosomes, with degradative cargo budding intraluminally to form multivesicular 
bodies (MVBs) prior to fusion with lysosomes where cargo degradation is completed 
within minutes (185). Endocytic organelles exhibit a complex morphological organi-
zation in the form of membrane vacuoles, cisternae, tubules, and multilamellar or 
multivesicular bodies, and differ in their biochemical composition and localization 
within the cell. In most non-neuronal cells, early endosomes are localized close to 
the cell periphery while recycling endosomes (REs) are generally found in the  
peri-centriolar area (Fig. 1) (185). This spatial segregation is likely crucial for the 
sequential processing of molecules as they progress from one compartment to the 
other (187). In neurons however, both early and REs are localized in dendrites re-
mote from cell body, potentially facilitating local processing of internalized cargo 
(63)."

(32, 191, 300). Interestingly, both measurements of transferrin uptake and immu-
nolabeling of hippocampal neuron dendrites indicate that REs are often localized at 
the base of the spine neck and occasionally in the spine head (Fig. 3b,c) (212, 213). 
Notably, REs translocate into spines upon LTP-inducing stimuli where they contrib-
ute exocytic membrane for spine growth during synapse potentiation (213). These 
observations demonstrate the presence of a dendritic endosomal network in close 
proximity to glutamatergic synapses and support a model for local synaptic protein 
recycling and degradation via endosomes. This issue is discussed in more detail in 
Sections 3.2. and 3.3.

2.3 Dendritic Mitochondria 
Synaptic remodeling requires membrane fission, fusion, protein degradation and local 
protein synthesis, all of which are ATP-dependent processes. Indeed mitochondria, 
strongly impregnated by common contrast agents used in electron microscopy, were 
one of the first dendritic organelles to be identified (217). Dendrite mitochondria are 
mainly located in the dendritic shaft, but can occasionally be found associated with 
spines (1, 31). Although dendritic mitochondria usually appear as individual units, 
three-dimensional EM reconstructions have documented the existence of continuous 
mitochondrial networks extending over 10–30 μm in dendrites of the CA1 region of 
rodent hippocampus (222). 
Dendritic mitochondria are quite dynamic. In addition to fusion and fission, mi-
tochondria can move over long distances in dendrites in an activity-dependent man-
ner (161). Synaptic stimulation decreases the mobility of mitochondria and induces 
their translocation into spines (161). Decreased mitochondrial mobility near active 
synapses and increased mobility in the absence of neural activity would be predicted 
to distribute mitochondria near highly active, high ATP-utilizing, dendritic regions. 
Consistent with this notion, reducing the number of dendritic mitochondria by domi-
nant-negative overexpression of the GTPase Drp1, a dynamin-like protein involved 
in mitochondrial fission, decreased the number of synapses. Conversely, increasing 
the number of dendritic mitochondria by overexpressing wild type Drp1 or increas-
ing mitochondrial function by treating cells with creatine, nearly doubled synapse 
number, demonstrating that synapse formation or maintenance is normally limited by 
mitochondrial activity (161). 
3 Polarized Trafficking and Long-Range Targeting to Synapses 
The maintenance of synaptic structures with distinct compositions and properties 
requires continuous and accurate targeting of newly synthesized proteins to their 
final destination. Like any polarized cell, but amplified due to their morphological 
complexity, neurons require sorting and targeting mechanisms to ensure the delivery 
of molecular components to the appropriate compartment. Cell compartmentalization 
is often most obvious at the plasma membrane where diffusion barriers prevent inte-
gral proteins from being freely exchanged from one compartment to another. In 
neurons, such barriers are present at the axon initial segment, preventing mixing of 
components of the axonal and somatodendritic membranes (145, 197, 301, 302). On 
a finer (and possibly more impressive) scale, the thousands of synaptic inputs that a 
given neuron receives further segment the somatodendritic membrane into an array 
of postsynaptic microdomains, each with specific compositions. This raises funda-
mental questions on how such an extreme degree of compartmentalization can be 
maintained."

3.1 Asymmetric Protein Trafficking in Neurons 
Much of what is known about protein trafficking in polarized cells comes from stud-
ies in epithelial cells, most prominently the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) 
cell-line, which differentiates in vitro into mono-layered epithelia with a well-
defined apical/basolateral asymmetry (235). Various modes of polarized trafficking 
have been described in this system, including selective sorting of cargo into special-
ized post-Golgi carriers directly targeted to specific cellular domains, and non-
specific delivery to the plasma membrane followed by endocytosis and transport to 
the appropriate destination (235, 289). 
Studies in MDCK cells have demonstrated that cargo sorting into distinct post-
Golgi carriers relies on intrinsic sequence determinants, with basolateral sorting 
sequences generally located in the cytoplasmic tail, and apical sorting sequences 
found frequently in the transmembrane domain (134, 235). Sorting into apical carri-
ers can also result from post-translational modifications, such as N- or O- glycosyla-
tion, or addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (235). When ex-
pressed in neurons, several basolateral and apical proteins are sorted preferentially to 
the somatodendritic compartment and axon respectively, including VSVG and LDL 
receptor (basolateral/somatodendritic), and influenza HA protein (apical/axonal) (60, 
61, 123). However, more recent experiments suggest that neurons do not recognize 
some dihydrophobic motifs directing cargo to the basolateral domain in epithelial 
cells (260). Additionally, the sequence determinant that directs transferrin receptor to 
the basolateral domain in epithelial cells overlaps only partially with the somatoden-
dritic targeting motif (300). Therefore, while many of the general principles of pro-
tein sorting established in epithelial cells apply to neurons, neurons have many of 
their own rules for establishing protein asymmetry. 
In addition to direct delivery of proteins to their final membrane destination, a 
more circuitous mode of polarized trafficking is observed in certain epithelial and 
endothelial cells, where cargo destined for the apical plasma membrane is first exo-
cytosed to the basolateral membrane and then endocytosed and transported to the 
apical membrane (289). Such transcytosis is also observed in neurons and accounts 
for the trafficking of certain proteins (e.g. VAMP2 and NgCAM/L1), which are 
initially delivered to the somatodendritic surface but ultimately localize to the pre-
synaptic terminal or axonal membrane (243, 303). Mutations disrupting VAMP2 
internalization leave VAMP2 stranded at the somatodendritic surface, indicating that 
its proper localization requires a redistribution occurring after endocytosis. While 
NgCAM is enriched in the axonal plasma membrane, intracellular NgCAM contain-
ing vesicles are found in both dendrites and axons (30), indicating that the steady 
state distribution of the molecule does not result from a vectorial targeting of post-
Golgi carriers. Monitoring NgCAM insertion in the cell-surface following a syn-
chronous release from the ER revealed that this protein first appears at the somato-
dendritic plasma membrane, and is subsequently internalized to be trafficked to the 
axon (243, 303). Interestingly, a single tyrosine point mutation (Y33A) results in 
direct axonal targeting of NgCAM (303), demonstrating that NgCAM can follow 
different routes to reach the same final destination. The direct targeting to the axon 
thus likely represents a default route for some axonal integral proteins."

Another example of polarized trafficking is neuronal potassium channels. Neu-
rons express a wide array of potassium channels, which regulate crucial aspects of 
cellular ion homeostasis and excitability. Although displaying very similar primary 
structures within particular subclasses, given channel isoforms can have distinct 
distribution in the neuronal plasma membrane as well as specific trafficking itinerar-
ies (101, 171). For example, while voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels Kv1.2, 
Kv1.3 and Kv1.4 are primarily found in the axonal plasma membrane, Kv4.2 is se-
lectively expressed at the somato-dendritic surface (256). The conserved structure 
and specific surface expression patterns of Kv channels allowed the identification of 
molecular determinants of asymmetric protein trafficking in neurons. Analysis of 
chimeric molecules led to the identification of a C-terminal 16 amino acid di-leucine 
motif required for the proper targeting of Kv4.2 and sufficient to target the axonally 
localized channels Kv1.3 and Kv1.4 to dendrites (233). Conversely, interaction of 
the cytoplasmic N-terminal T1 tetramerization domain of Kv1 channels with Kvβ 
subunits is required for Kv1 expression at the axonal membrane and is sufficient to 
target dendritic molecules such as the transferrin receptor to the axonal surface (91). 
Similar approaches led to the characterization of the molecular address targeting 
the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit to the somatodendritic compartment. This deter-
minant resides in the proximal segment of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of GluR1 
and is sufficient to redirect otherwise axonally expressed proteins such as influenza 
virus hemagglutinin to the somatodendritic membrane (239). 
3.2 Polarized Secretory Trafficking for Asymmetric Dendrite Outgrowth 
In addition to membrane protein processing, the ER and the Golgi are the primary 
site of lipid biosynthesis (163), a metabolic function subject to considerable chal-
lenge during the massive expansion of the plasma membrane that occurs during 
neurite outgrowth. Consistent with an immediate requirement for membrane traffick-
ing through the secretory pathway in dendrite growth, disrupting Golgi function with 
brefeldin A in developing hippocampal or cortical pyramidal neurons dramatically 
reduces dendritic growth and branching (108). Perhaps more surprisingly, in mature 
cortical pyramidal neurons the same treatment causes a dramatic simplification of 
dendrite morphology, demonstrating the importance of an ongoing membrane flux 
through the secretory pathway for the maintenance of dendritic arbors (108). 
The site of membrane insertion in growing dendrites is uncertain, but the spatial 
organization of the neuronal secretory pathway provides some clues. Somatic Golgi 
is nearly always oriented toward the apical dendrite in hippocampal pyramidal cells 
in vivo, and toward the longest and most branched dendrite of hippocampal neurons 
Finally, of particular interest is the tendency of certain receptors and ion channels 
to have unusual reverse gradient concentration along dendrites, with distal dendrites 
displaying a higher concentration of receptors/channels than proximal ones. This is 
notably the case of AMPA receptors (7, 262) and HCN1 channels (167), whose  
distance-dependent enrichment along apical dendrites is important for the scaling of 
dendritic currents and their integration in the soma of hippocampal pyramidal neu-
rons (73). This suggests differential regulation of protein trafficking or stability as a 
function of dendritic distance, a possibility that still awaits further investigation."

in culture (Fig. 2b) (108). As a consequence, most post-Golgi flux originating from 
the somatic Golgi is directed toward the apical dendrite. Disrupting the polarization 
of the somatic Golgi by overexpressing GRASP65, a Golgi matrix protein required 
for cisternal stacking (6), blocks the specification of the apical dendrite without di-
minishing the overall rate and extent of total dendrite growth (108), demonstrating 
that polarized post-Golgi trafficking sustains asymmetric dendritic growth. 
In another study, the centrosome and associated organelles were found to cluster 
at sites opposite of the plane of final mitotic division of neural progenitors at a loca-
tion where the first neurite emerges and becomes the axon (51). However, at slightly 
later developmental stages after initial neurite outgrowth but before either polarized 
growth or the appearance of spatially restricted axonal markers (hippocampal neuron 
polarity stage 1 in the scheme of Banker) (62), the somatic Golgi shows no polariza-
tion towards the axon (108). One possibility is that post-Golgi trafficking is redi-
rected from axons to dendrites at different developmental stages, during migration, 
or in different in vivo contexts. Interestingly, disrupting the secretory pathway by 
overexpressing a kinase-dead form of protein kinase D1 that prevents cargo budding 
from the TGN (14), results in cessation of dendritic growth while axonal growth 
persists over days (108), indicating that distinct mechanisms govern membrane addi-
tion to the growing axon. Thus, akin to what occurs during polarization of non-
neuronal cell architecture (69, 148), reorganization of the secretory pathway is essen-
tial for the asymmetric growth of dendrites. In this context, it is interesting to note 
that several molecules implicated in neurite polarization and outgrowth, such as 
PI3K, LIMK1, and Cdk5, are localized to the Golgi apparatus (6, 208, 238), suggest-
ing close coordination between dendritic compartmentalization, polarized cell 
growth, and directed membrane trafficking through the neuronal Golgi. 
3.3 Microtubule Transport 
The cytoskeleton provides anchoring points for the stabilization and transport of 
cellular structures, and is a major determinant of cell architecture. The microtubule 
network provides tracks along which cargo including organelles, vesicles, and 
mRNA granules is transported over long distances. In some instances, stabilization 
of microtubule plus ends allows direct vectorial delivery of cargo to subcompart-
ments of the plasma membrane, as observed for the targeting of gap junction compo-
nents to epithelial cell adherens junctions (255). In a comparable manner, the estab-
lishment of a subsynaptic secretory pathway at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) or 
in Torpedo electrocytes also involves a local reorganization of microtubules (33, 
124–126, 229). 
The organization of neuronal microtubules presents interesting specializations. In 
model non-neuronal cell types, most microtubules share the same polarity and are 
arranged in a radial manner with their minus end anchored at the microtubule orga-
nizing center (MTOC) and their plus end radiating towards the cell periphery (280). 
In contrast, neuronal microtubules in proximal dendrites adopt both plus end-out and 
plus end-in orientations while axons and distal dendrites contain microtubules with 
their plus ends pointing away from the cell body (12). Although the bidirectional"

organization of microtubules predicts significant complexity for dendritic membrane 
trafficking, the precise physiological consequences remain largely unknown. 
Active movement of cargo along microtubules requires two classes of motor pro-
teins – the large family of kinesins and cytoplasmic dynein. These microtubule mo-
tors move, in most cases, towards the plus and minus ends of microtubules, respec-
tively (293). Indeed, the first kinesin to be described was characterized as the 
molecular motor responsible for fast axonal transport (23, 294). Subsequently, at 
least 45 members of the kinesin family have been discovered in mammals (102). 
Some of these kinesins play distinct roles in dendrites. For example, KIFC2 and 
KIF5 (the conventional kinesin, also known as kinesin1), localize to the somatoden-
dritic compartment, where they are required for trafficking multivesicular bodies and 
mRNA granules (137, 241). 
In a recent study, Banker and colleagues showed that the behavior of specific 
kinesins changes during early stages of neuronal morphogenesis. Whereas truncated 
kinesin 3 accumulates at the tip of all neurites throughout development, truncated 
kinesin 1 localizes to only a subset of neurites and rapidly redistributes in the emerg-
ing axon (119). This event represents one of the earliest molecular readouts of axon 
specification, and demonstrates that neurite differentiation involves a tight control of 
the microtubule network and associated kinesin-based transport. 
3.4 Synaptic Targeting: Postsynaptic Receptors as Model Cargo 
Postsynaptic receptors are highly enriched at synapses, where they form microdo-
mains apposed to presynaptic active zones releasing cognate neurotransmitters. This 
accumulation depends on postsynaptic scaffolds, which stabilize receptors and con-
nect them to downstream signaling effectors (see Chapter by Kennedy et al., this 
volume). Time-lapse imaging and photobleaching of GFP-tagged receptors (10, 11, 
147, 254, 258) as well as real-time imaging of single fluorescent probes bound to 
In the last ten years, biochemical characterization established that postsynaptic 
receptors are found with their interacting partners in large protein complexes con-
taining an unexpectedly broad cast of molecular motors, especially kinesins, indicat-
ing that receptor microtubule transport is a fundamental aspect of postsynaptic recep-
tor biology (138). This notion has been directly demonstrated for KIF17 which is 
required for the delivery of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors to synapses (92, 
251). Interestingly, interaction with different cargo can “steer” kinesins to specific 
cellular domains. For example, the glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1), 
which binds the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2, directs KIF5 primarily to the soma-
todendritic domain, while a different kinesin binding protein, JSAP1, routes KIF5 to 
the axon (252). In addition to participating in AMPA receptor trafficking, the 
GRIP1/KIF5 interaction has important functions in dendrite development and main-
tenance. Decreasing GRIP1 expression by RNA interference (RNAi) causes a loss of 
dendrites which can be rescued by overexpression of EphB2 (104), a receptor tyro-
sine kinase known to affect spine development and synaptic plasticity (117). Con-
versely, disrupting the GRIP1/KIF5 interaction impairs EphB2 trafficking to den-
drites and inhibits dendritic growth, supporting a model where GRIP1 acts as a 
kinesin adaptor important for dendritic trafficking (104, 252)."

surface receptors has revealed that receptors continuously diffuse in and out syn-
apses, occasionally exploring multiple synapses (20, 50, 64, 278) (see Chapter by 
Choquet and Triller, this volume). These latter experimental approaches highlight the 
highly dynamic and probabilistic nature of receptor stabilization at synapses, empha-
sizing the importance of lateral diffusion (287). Indeed, upon expressing recombi-
nant glycine receptor subunits under conditions where receptor exocytosis was de-
tected only in the soma, it was found that lateral diffusion is sufficient for receptor 
accumulation at synapses on distal dendrites (237). 
The relative contribution of vesicular trafficking and lateral diffusion to the traf-
ficking of postsynaptic receptors remains a topic of active investigation. In some 
instances, both modes of trafficking have been found to contribute for a given recep-
tor or membrane cargo. For example, while immunogold labeling and biochemical 
data suggest that microtubule dependent transport is a major mode of NMDA recep-
tor targeting to synapses, live cell imaging indicates that synapses either receive 
quantal “packets” of NMDA receptors (299), or can gradually acquire NMDA recep-
tors (25). While the latter study supports a “diffusional” accumulation of NMDA 
receptors, the former supports a direct delivery by discrete intracellular carriers. 
Monitoring the recovery of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents following 
irreversible inactivation with the open-channel blocker MK801 demonstrated that 
synaptic NMDA receptors exchange with their extrasynaptic counterparts (286). 
Comparable approaches applied to GABAA receptors (281) and AMPA receptors (2) 
support the same general conclusion. 
In the case of AMPA receptors, local activity at single synapses reduces the lat-
eral mobility of GluR1, leading to accumulation of receptors by a diffusional trap 
(64), while local exocytosis from recycling endosomes supplies receptors for LTP 
(147, 212). Exocytosis and lateral diffusion are thus likely subject to distinct forms 
of regulation for different classes of receptors and membrane cargo (38, 203). Rec-
onciliation of these two modes of synaptic trafficking (lateral diffusion versus vecto-
rial vesicular targeting) awaits further investigation. Yet, the architecture of the den-
dritic membrane provides some interesting clues. 
Most central excitatory synapses are localized on dendritic spines, and are thus 
isolated from the dendrite proper by the narrow spine neck, which limits exchange 
of cytoplasmic and integral membrane proteins between the spine head and the 
dendritic shaft (10, 11, 18, 232). Local diffusible pools of membrane cargo inside 
spines would thus provide a reserve pool for synaptic exchange (103). Utilization 
of vesicular traffic locally within spines, in turn, requires the positioning or mobi-
lization of vesicle budding and trafficking machinery. The combination of a lim-
ited local pool of reserve cargo together with spine-localized membrane trafficking 
Although lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane is a major aspect of receptor 
movement and exchange, endocytosis and exocytosis are also crucial for rapid varia-
tions of receptor amount at synapses (see Chapters by Esteban, Wenthold et al., 
Lorena Arancibia-Carcamo et al., and Lisman and Hell, this volume). However, if 
exo- and endocytosis can occur locally in close proximity to excitatory synapses, 
membrane fusion and budding have not been demonstrated directly at the PSD (see 
Section 4 below), implying that lateral diffusion is an obligatory step for receptors to 
enter or exit synapses (287)."

potentially affords exquisite control or “tuning” of molecular abundance at syn-
apses via the balance of exocytosis, endocytosis and diffusional exchange. On the 
other hand, synapses onto dendritic shafts, including most GABAergic synapses, 
have direct access to a much larger surface pool of extrasynaptic receptors and are 
likely less affected by short term changes in the balance between exo- and endocy-
tosis. Such constraints of geometry might help explain the distinct mechanisms for 
targeting and maintaining postsynaptic membrane components at excitatory spine 
synapses versus inhibitory shaft synapses (see Chapter by Lorena Arancibia-
Carcamo et al., this volume). 
3.5 Pre-assembly of Postsynaptic Membranes in the Secretory Pathway 
The function of the ER and the Golgi apparatus in membrane trafficking extends 
beyond transmembrane protein processing. These organelles also direct the traffick-
ing of cytoplasmic proteins modified by acylation. Indeed, acyltransferases, the core 
enzymes mediating protein palmitoylation localize to the Golgi apparatus (231, 263). 
The addition of a lipid moiety to proteins increases their hydrophobicity and facili-
tates their incorporation in lipid rafts (263), which participate in the nano-
organization of cellular membranes by stabilizing multi-protein complexes (57, 115). 
Interestingly, numerous synaptic proteins, including cytoplasmic molecules, are 
palmitoylated. As shown directly for GRIP, PSD-95, AMPA receptors (GluR1-
GluR4), ACh receptors, and GABAA receptors, palmitoylation regulates synaptic 
targeting and stabilization (56, 66, 67, 71, 97). PSD-95, the major postsynaptic scaf-
fold protein at glutamateric synapses, is palmitoylated by HIP14, while specific 
AMPA receptor and GABAA receptor subunits are palmitoylated by GODZ, two 
palmitoylating enzymes primarily localized to the Golgi (71, 74, 113, 133, 230, 261). 
As described at central synapses (56, 66, 67, 94, 172, 245), and in Torpedo 
electrocytes (175, 176), several postsynaptic scaffold proteins are localized to 
intracellular membranes containing receptors that likely correspond to compart-
ments of the secretory pathway. Live cell imaging experiments have revealed the 
appearance and transport of PSD scaffold proteins such as PSD-95 as discrete 
clusters in dendrites (78, 177, 204). In the case of PSD-95, dendritic transport 
occurs through the secretory pathway (66) and can be stimulated by BDNF (307). 
The origin of these “pre-packaged” secretory carriers and the adaptor molecules or 
coat proteins involved in cargo sorting from earlier stages in the secretory pathway 
are not yet clear. However, many of these transported scaffold proteins are lipid 
modified, suggesting that acylation at the Golgi apparatus is an important step in 
scaffold protein targeting, and may direct the pre-assembly of postsynaptic mem-
branes in the secretory patway. PSD95 is particularly interesting in this regard 
since its palmitoylation is regulated by synaptic activity (67), and is essential for 
its co-trafficking with AMPA receptors (66), its targeting to synapses (49, 66), and 
its ability to cluster transmembrane proteins (41)."

4 Local Trafficking of Postsynaptic Components 
4.1 Dendritic Exocytosis 
4.1.1 Regulated Exocytosis Near the Postsynaptic Membrane  
Membrane fusion requires the concerted action of numerous factors to first tether a 
vesicle to the membrane, prime it for release, and finally to fuse the separate lipid 
bilayers into a contiguous membrane (120). The eukaryotic membrane fusion ma-
chinery has been conserved during evolution, and consists of a core complex of the 
soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) 
family of proteins. As elucidated in detail for exocytosis in presynaptic nerve termi-
nals (see Chapter by Atasoy and Kavalali, this volume), vesicle-bound SNARES (v-
SNARES) form a complex with target membrane associated SNARES (t-SNARES) 
through coiled-coil motifs in a process facilitated by members of the Rab family of 
small GTPases (120). Accessory proteins superimposed on this core machinery allow 
for regulation of exocytosis by coupling membrane fusion to diverse signaling path-
ways. Many of the principles governing regulated exocytosis have been established 
by studies on the Ca2+-dependent release of synaptic vesicles (see Chapter by Atasoy 
and Kavalali, this volume). 
Although less well understood than synaptic vesicle release, dendritic exocytosis 
has emerged as a key mechanism for regulating synaptic physiology. Among the first 
indications of regulated exocytosis in dendrites came from experiments demonstrat-
ing that the styryl dye FM1-43 accumulates in dendritic TGN-derived compartments 
and can be rapidly unloaded in response to Ca2 influx (174). The finding that this 
activity-dependent dendritic exocytosis required CaMKII (173) pointed towards a 
direct link between postsynaptic exocytosis and synaptic plasticity signaling path-
ways. Additional evidence for such a link came from observations that brefeldin A, 
which disrupts the secretory pathway, impairs synaptic potentiation in hippocampal 
slices, as does postsynaptic loading of N-ethylmaleimide or botulinum toxin B, two 
inhibitors of membrane fusion (28, 166). In conjunction with the discovery of silent 
synapses lacking AMPA receptors (see Chapters by Esteban and Lisman and Hell, 
this volume), these observations suggested that the rapid insertion of AMPA recep-
tors in the postsynaptic membrane accounted for an early component of the expres-
sion of LTP. Subsequent imaging studies demonstrated that AMPA receptors rapidly 
appear and accumulate near the postsynaptic plasma membrane and are incorporated 
into synapses in response to stimuli triggering synapse potentiation (45, 147, 212). 
However, the core machinery for postsynaptic exocytosis and the mechanisms cou-
pling NMDA receptor-induced Ca2+ influx to dendritic membrane fusion remain 
poorly understood. Moreover, the exact location of receptor insertion in the dendritic 
membrane is unclear, although NMDA receptor-induced exocytic events have re-
cently been visualized in spines (213). For AMPA receptors, either the site of exocy-
tosis or the location of rapid receptor accumulation after exocytosis, depends on 
subunit composition, since newly inserted GluR2 receptors accumulate more rapidly 
at synapses than do GluR1 receptors (214, 257). This suggests that a subclass of exo-
cytic vesicles containing distinct populations of receptors may be inserted in close"

proximity to synapses (Fig. 4). Such exocytic vesicles may derive from recycling 
endosomes, which traffic into spines and fuse with the spine membrane during LTP-
induced potentiation and spine growth (213).

vided by local synthesis in the secretory pathway (a), vesicular transport along microtubules 
(dendritic shaft) and F-actin (spines) (b), and lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane (c). 
Vesicles are translocated through the spine neck and can release cargo directly in the spine 
head by exocytosis (d). Cargo molecules are stabilized at the postsynaptic membrane but can 
diffuse in and out the postsynaptic density (PSD). Released receptors and other integral mem-
brane proteins are captured and internalized by the spine endocytic zone located laterally to 
the PSD (e). Internalized receptors are sorted in early/sorting endosomes (SE) and sent either 
to late endosomes (LE) for degradation, or to recycling endosomes (RE) for return to the spine 
surface (f). Abbreviations. SER, smooth endoplasmic reticulum; RER, rough endoplasmic

Although initially described at vertebrate NMJs or in Torpedo electrocytes (33, 
124, 125, 229), sub-synaptic trafficking compartments have been characterized in 
detail in larval Drosophila neuromuscular synapses (179, 180, 266). Genetic ap-
proaches in this system have provided important clues to the molecular mechanisms"

accounting for postsynaptic exocytosis. For example, the SNARE protein Gtaxin 
interacts with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein Dlg and is required for the tar-
geted delivery of membranes to the postsynapse (82). In addition, synaptotagmin 4 
serves as a Ca2+ sensor for postsynaptic exocytosis at the fly neuromuscular synapse 
(306), suggesting that mechanisms responsible for regulated postsynaptic exocytosis 
may be very similar to those operating at presynaptic terminals (see Chapter by 
Atasoy and Kavalali, this volume). Despite these initial clues, many questions re-
main, such as the identity and requirement for specific molecules that tether postsy-
naptic vesicles to the plasma membrane, and the nature of machinery linking postsy-
naptic exocytosis to neural activity. 
4.1.2 Rab Proteins and Dendritic Exocytosis  
In addition to SNARE proteins, Rab family GTPases are major regulators of mem-
brane trafficking and vesicular fusion. Rab proteins localize to distinct cellular com-
partments and control trafficking specificity by facilitating interactions between 
donor and acceptor membranes (90). In general, Rab proteins bind to donor mem-
branes in their GTP-bound state and recruit accessory factors that interact with pro-
teins on the target membrane. When the appropriate combination of vesicle and 
target membrane proteins is assembled, Rab proteins hydrolyze their bound GTP, 
locking the vesicle in place for subsequent fusion (90). 
Two Rab proteins with well-defined function in non-neuronal cells have been 
shown to regulate postsynaptic receptor exocytosis. Rab11a controls trafficking 
through recycling endosomes (291) and is required for NMDA receptor-dependent 
synapse potentiation including LTP (212). Rab8 is involved in trafficking from the 
TGN to the cell surface (114) and is also required for the postsynaptic delivery of 
AMPA receptor subunits (76). Rab11 resides in recycling endosomes, a compart-
ment through which trafficking is mediated by vesicular fusion involving syntaxin 13 
(226). Acute disruption of syntaxin 13-dependent trafficking abolishes stimulus-
dependent insertion of AMPA receptors and accompanying LTP within minutes 
(212), suggesting that this membrane trafficking pathway is immediately proximal to 
NMDA receptor-induced dendritic exocytosis. Still to be determined are the molecu-
lar mechanisms underlying synaptic activity-dependent regulation of Rab8 and 
Rab11. Rab-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase acti-
vating proteins (GAPs) orchestrate Rab protein function by controlling their activa-
tion and inactivation (79, 250), and are themselves controlled by numerous signaling 
pathways (250), making them particularly attractive candidates for coupling neural 
activity to postsynaptic exocytosis. 
4.1.3 Myosin Motors and Micron-Range Trafficking of Spine Cargo  
In non-neuronal cells, post-TGN transport of secretory cargo to the plasma mem-
brane occurs in two general stages. Vesicles are first transported along microtubules 
towards the cell-periphery by kinesins, and are then transferred to myosin motors, 
most prominently class V myosins, which translocate vesicles through the F-actin 
network of the cell cortex to bring them close to the plasma membrane (152). Myosins"

are multisubunit motor molecules that move cargo along F-actin in a unidirectional 
manner. Myosin motors have diverse functions in vesicle trafficking. At the plasma 
membrane, myosins control movements of vesicles during exocytosis and endocyto-
sis (152). Many types of myosins are expressed in neurons, and although their indi-
vidual roles are only beginning to emerge, they seem to be especially important for 
synaptic receptor recycling (26) (Fig. 4). This is particularly true for class V and 
class VI myosins, which are enriched in dendritic spines (165, 196, 206). While 
myosin VI regulates AMPA receptor endocytosis by virtue of its ability to move 
vesicles inward toward the pointed or minus-ends of actin filaments (206), members 
of the myosin V family facilitate delivery of AMPA receptors to the dendritic mem-
brane (165). 
Interestingly, a light chain common to myosin V and dynein indirectly interacts 
with AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors via GKAP/PSD95 (196), and class V 
myosins also associate with specific kinesins (152). Glutamate receptors are thus part 
of multi-protein complexes containing both microtubule and actin motors, a feature 
that is likely important for the transfer of receptor containing vesicles from the 
microtubule-rich dendritic shaft to spines, whose cytoskeleton primarily consists of 
actin. Recent in vitro experiments demonstrated that myosin Va can traverse fila-
mentous junctions and displays diffusive “scanning” along microtubules (4), empha-
sizing the ability of this motor to navigate complex cytoskeletal structures. 
4.1.4 The Exocyst  
Class V myosins are calmodulin-binding molecules and are regulated by cal-
cium-dependent conformational changes (279). Increasing calcium triggers a con-
formational change of myosin Va from a closed, inactive, conformation to an open 
conformation that exposes the cargo binding domain. Although not yet fully charac-
terized in neurons, this calcium-dependent regulation of class V myosins could play 
a role in activity-dependent trafficking of cargo to dendritic spines. Indeed myosin 
Va is highly enriched in the PSD (196, 297). However, dilute mutant mice lacking 
myosin Va have no defects in basal synaptic transmission or LTP at CA1 hippocam-
pal synapses (248) and exhibit no quantitative difference in AMPA receptor abun-
dance at synapses when assessed by immungold electron microscopy (218). 
Genetic studies of targeted membrane trafficking in S. cerevisiae led to the identifi-
cation of conserved proteins important for the late processing of post-Golgi vesicles. 
Among these proteins were components of the exocyst, an octameric protein com-
plex whose subunits (Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo 70 and Exo84) are 
required for tethering vesicles to distinct cellular domains (164). 
In Drosophila, Sec5 and Sec6 mutants display defective neurite outgrowth re-
sulting from impaired exocytosis (192, 193). However, synaptic vesicle exocytosis 
at the neuromuscular junction is normal in Sec5 mutants, indicating that the exo-
cyst is not involved in all forms of exocytosis (192). Other studies in flies revealed 
a specific role for Sec15 in axon outgrowth and delivery of a subset of surface 
proteins to the plasma membrane (e.g. fasciclin II and chaoptin) (186), suggesting 
that particular components of the exocyst complex play distinct roles in neuronal 
trafficking."

Components of the exocyst complex are expressed in the mammalian nervous 
system (112), and notably in the developing brain where Sec6/8 is present in layers 
displaying ongoing synaptogenesis (98). At later stages, the exocyst is broadly ex-
pressed in the adult brain and is enriched in synaptic membranes (112, 244). Consis-
tent with a role in directing exocytosis to discrete domains, Sec6/8 is located at sites 
of membrane addition, including neurites, filopodia, and growth cones in cultured 
hippocampal neurons (98, 296). More recently, the exocyst has been shown to par-
ticipate in the trafficking of glutamate receptors to the synapse. Specifically, Sec8 
contains a PDZ-binding motif that interacts with the synaptic scaffolding proteins 
PSD-95 and SAP102 (244). This interaction thus connects the exocyst complex to 
NMDA receptors and potentially AMPA receptor/TARP complexes, and is required 
for NMDA receptor trafficking to the cell surface (244). 
The exocyst also plays an important role during late stages of receptor delivery to 
the plasma membrane, including in the spine head itself. Overexpression of truncated 
forms of Sec8 and Exo70 uncovered two successive exocyst-dependent steps of 
AMPA receptor exocytosis required for the turnover of synaptic receptors. Whereas 
impairment of Sec8 leads to the accumulation of AMPA receptor-containing vesicles 
in the dendritic shaft, overexpression of Exo70 mutant results in an accumulation of 
these vesicles in the spine head, leaving them stranded very close to the PSD (77). 
These data support the notion that AMPA receptor exocytosis can occur directly in 
spines, and that exocyst subunits play distinct and synergistic functions in the local 
targeting or tethering of receptor-laden vesicles. 
4.2 Dendritic Endocytosis and Post-Endocytic Sorting 
Eukaryotic cells continuously invaginate and internalize portions of their plasma 
membrane to take up extracellular nutrients, trophic factors, and pathogens, as well 
as to regulate their surface area and control surface levels of membrane proteins. 
Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is the best characterized mechanism of membrane 
protein internalization (139), and has been widely studied in presynaptic terminals 
where it mediates the retrieval of synaptic vesicles (see Chapter by McPherson et al., 
this volume). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is initiated by adaptor proteins, such as 
AP-2, AP-180, and epsin, which associate with phosphoinositides and membrane 
protein cargo and nucleate the oligomerization of clathrin into a lattice, or coat, ap-
posed to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane (215). Upon acquisition of 
membrane curvature and invagination, clathrin-coated pits bud from the membrane 
to form clathrin-coated vesicles (118, 215). The fission reaction is mediated by 
members of the dynamin family of large GTPases, which assemble into oligomeric 
rings or spirals around the necks of coated pits (223). All three dynamin family 
members (dynamins 1–3) are expressed in neurons. While dynamin 2 is ubiquitious 
and mediates membrane fission in all cells of the body, dynamin 1 is specialized for 
membrane recycling of synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic terminal following  
exocytosis (273). Like dynamin 1, dynamin 3 is enriched in brain, but also localizes 
postsynaptically to dendritic spine heads and may play a role in postsynaptic mem-
brane trafficking (87, 292)."

Exocytosis, endocytosis and post-endocytic sorting represent important check-
points for controlling cell-surface signaling. Although relying on the same basic 
machinery, turnover rates of surface proteins vary greatly, with internalization time 
constants ranging from seconds for membrane retrival at presynaptic terminals (273), 
to minutes in the case of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (267) and postsynap-
tic receptors (63, 141, 162). In addition to simply controlling the number of cell-
surface receptors, endocytosis is intimately coupled to receptor signaling. A classic 
example of this is provided by GPCRs and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), whose 
endocytosis is stimulated by agonist binding, and desensitizes the cell toward the 
receptor ligand (267). In some cases, endocytosis itself is required for signaling since 
some receptors initiate signal transduction from internal endosomes (54, 99, 110, 
305). 
Endocytosis and endosomal sorting of postsynaptic receptors have emerged as 
key mechanisms for tuning synaptic responses rapidly within minutes, or more 
slowly during homeostatic scaling and synapse development (45, 290). It is now 
clear that postsynaptic compartments possess an exquisite degree of specialization 
for receptor internalization and post-endocytic trafficking (Fig. 4). This specializa-
tion is reflected by the diverse stimuli that trigger postsynaptic endocytosis, the com-
plex biochemical interactions that link synaptic receptors to endocytic effectors, and 
the organization of the spine membrane itself. 
4.2.1 Activity-Dependent Regulation of Endocytosis and Post-endocytic Sorting  
One indication of an intimate relationship between postsynaptic proteins and endo-
cytic machinery comes from biochemical data showing that postsynaptic receptors 
and scaffolds directly interact with the endocytic machinery. For example, Homer 
and mGluR5 interact with dynamin 3 (87), and both the AMPA receptor subunit 
GluR2 and the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B interact with the AP-2 clathrin adap-
tor complex (130, 155, 158, 234). The GABAA receptor subunits β1-3 and γ2 also 
bind AP-2, indicating that similar mechanisms operate at inhibitory synapses (141). 
Consistently, interfering with receptor internalization leads to modifications of both 
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses, sometime within minutes (45). Indeed, 
the regulation of postsynaptic receptor endocytosis is a key set-point for various 
form of synaptic plasticity. 
As initially established for AMPA receptors, internalization rates and post-
endocytic sorting are directly modulated by synaptic activity (63, 159, 162). Various 
mechanisms account for the regulation of AMPA receptor endocytosis, and endocy-
tosis can be triggered either directly by agonist binding, or indirectly by Ca2+- and 
phosphatase-dependent signaling cascades. Control of postsynaptic receptor inter-
nalization involves a broad cast of proteins, including hippocalcin (211), Rab5 (29), 
CPG2 (48), Arc/Arg3.1. (40), and a significant array of receptor binding partners 
(45) (see Chapters by Esteban, Wenthold et al., and Lorena Arancibia-Carcamo et 
al., this volume). 
The actin cytoskeleton is a critical determinant of the local dynamics of mem-
brane proteins (150), and actin dynamics are tightly controlled at all steps of endocy-
tosis (68). Accordingly, actin polymerization and depolymerization are required for"

stimulus-dependent endocytosis of AMPA receptors (309), and actin plays a critical 
role in the structural maintenance and plasticity of dendritic spines. It is thus not 
surprising that spines contain numerous actin regulatory proteins (58). Some of these 
proteins, notably cortactin (88, 195, 228), Arc/Arg3.1 (40, 170) and myosin VI (206) 
participate in AMPA receptor endocytosis. In the case of NMDA receptors, the en-
docytic adaptor PACSIN-1/syndapin-1, which interacts with dynamin and N-WASP 
and thereby couples actin dynamics to endocytosis (136), directly binds the noncan-
onical subunit NR3A and drives receptor internalization (216). That actin dynamics 
is itself regulated by synaptic activity (43, 205, 269) suggests that cytoskeletal re-
modeling links activity-dependent signaling to the endocytic machinery. 
Following endocytosis, the fate of internalized postsynaptic cargo is governed by 
extrinsic factors such as synaptic activity or metabotropic receptors. For example, 
while AMPA receptors internalized in response to AMPA stimulation are trafficked 
to dendritic lysosomes and degraded, receptors internalized in response to NMDA 
stimulation are sorted into recycling endosomes in a PKA-dependent manner (63). 
This endosomal sorting is regulated by the duration of the stimulus (265) and can in 
turn be altered by long-term changes in network activity (159, 201). In a comparable 
manner, synaptic activity also determines the fate of internalized kainate receptors 
(178). The subunit composition within a given receptor subtype also modifies the 
behavior of internalized receptors. In the case of NMDA receptors, NR2A and NR2B 
subunits contain distinct post-endocytic sorting motifs, which direct them along 
degradative and recycling pathways, respectively (154). In addition, both NR1 and 
NR2 subunits contain conserved membrane proximal motifs, which direct internal-
ized receptors for degradation by default if not counteracted by the C-terminal recy-
cling motifs present in NR2B (249). 
4.2.2 The Spine Endocytic Zone  
By directly visualizing clathrin coats, Blanpied et al. (2002) showed that clathrin 
puncta localize to most hippocampal dendritic spines in close proximity to the PSD 
(Fig. 5ab) (17). Live cell imaging together with fluorescence recovery after photo-
bleaching (FRAP) indicated that clathrin repeatedly assembles and disassembles at 
specific endocytic sites in dendrites and spines (17). The concentration and internali-
zation of labeled transferrin at these spine clathrin puncta established that they are 
functional, thus demonstrating the existence of stable endocytic zones in close asso-
ciation with the PSD at glutamatergic synapses (17). Ultrastructural analysis con-
firmed the presence of coated structures in spines in vivo recapitulating all the early 
stages of the endocytic process (Fig. 5c) (219, 228). Immunogold labeling of its core 
components revealed an exquisite level of spatial organization of the clathrin endo-
cytic machinery in spines, where AP-2, clathrin and dynamin are localized on the 
lateral side of the spine surface, with AP-2 closest and dynamin furthest from the 
PSD (228) (Fig. 5d). In some cases, clathrin and AP-2 are detected at the spine 
plasma membrane in the absence of a morphologically identified coated pit (228) 
(Fig. 5d), suggesting a pre-organization of endocytic molecules at the lateral spine 
membrane."

These data demonstrate that endocytosis occurs in spines, raising important ques-
tions regarding the subsynaptic trafficking via endosomes. Functional studies of the 
clathrin- and early endosome-associated small GTPase Rab5 showed that it is localized 
to the perimeter of the PSD and facilitates AMPA receptor internalization in response 
to LTD-inducing stimuli (29). Rab5 overexpression does not alter the spine/shaft ratio 
of total (internal and surface) AMPA receptors, but rather selectively decreases the 
number of receptors at the spine surface (29). This indicates that some internalized 
receptors remain in the spine, supporting a model where receptors internalized at endo-
cytic zones on the spine surface are retained in a local endosomal pool (Fig. 4). 
While the presence of endocytic zones at inhibitory synapses has not been exten-
sively studied, immunolabeling of newly endocytosed GABAA receptors docu-
mented the presence of a stable pool of internalized receptors in close proximity to 
inhibitory synapses (295). Although the identity of these compartments awaits fur-
ther investigation, these findings suggest that specialized endocytic machinery may 
also exist at inhibitory synapses. In this context, it is interesting to note that 
GRIP1/ABP, a molecule involved in the control of AMPA receptor intracellular 
trafficking, is also localized to inhibitory synapses and is found in internal membrane 
compartments containing inhibitory receptors (56, 59, 140), suggesting that the con-
trol of inhibitory and excitatory receptor endocytosis might share common effectors 
in addition to AP-2 and clathrin.

4.2.3 Recycling Endosomes as a Mobilizable Source of Postsynaptic Cargo  
Quantitative analysis of AMPA receptor internalization and re-insertion in the 
plasma membrane in cultured cortical neurons has provided important insight into 
the involvement of post-endocytic recycling in synaptic remodeling (63, 162). Inter-
nalization of cell-surface AMPA receptors occurs with a time constant of approxi-
mately 10 min under basal conditions, and reaches a steady state that plateaus after 
15–20 min, a time point at which approximately 15–20% of initially labeled recep-
tors are internalized (63, 162). This apparent rate represents a balance between endo-
cytosis itself and cycling of molecules (initially labeled when at the cell-surface) 
between endosomes and the plasma membrane. 
Focusing selectively on the exocytosis of internalized molecules, it was shown 
that almost 90% of internalized receptors are reinserted in the cell-surface within 60 
min under basal conditions, with a similar time constant of 10 min (63). As with 
internalization, the rate or reinsertion is directly modulated by neuronal activity. This 
demonstrates that both endocytosis and reinsertion are controlled by activity, and 
also indicates that the kinetics of reinsertion to the cell-surface can determine the 
speed and timing of receptor turnover. Adding to this rather complex regulation of 
trafficking kinetics, selective activation of synaptic AMPA receptors and NMDA 
receptors can change the compartmental itinerary of internalized cargo by differen-
tially routing internalized AMPA receptors for lysosomal degradation, which in turn 
leads to changes in the number of receptors in the recycling pool (63, 159, 162). Alto-
gether, these data strongly suggest that recycling endosomes function as a kinetic trap 
whereby activity-dependent tuning of receptor recycling kinetics and endosomal sort-
ing controls the abundance of postsynaptic receptors in an online fashion (Fig. 4). 
As previously mentioned, morphological studies have demonstrated the presence 
of an endosomal network throughout dendrites, and have specifically shown that 
recycling endosomes (REs) reside at the base of, and in some instance within, den-
dritic spines (Fig. 3) (47, 63, 213). This spatial distribution of REs is particularly 
surprising given that these compartments are usually found in the peri-nuclear area in 
non-neuronal cells (Fig. 1) (187), and suggests that dendritic REs may play a general 
role in a local trafficking of postsynaptic cargo. Indeed, whereas some dendritic 
AMPA receptors are transported to the cell body after endocytosis, an important 
fraction of internalized receptors remain in dendrites (63, 159, 162). Mechanisms by 
which different classes of endosomes are positioned in dendrites and spines, and the 
machinery that determines whether internalized postsynaptic cargo molecules are de-
graded or locally recycled back to the dendritic surface are only beginning to emerge. 
The neuron-enriched endosomal protein of 21 kDa (Neep21) localizes to early 
endosomes and facilitates recycling of surface receptors (53, 271). In hippocampal 
neurons Neep21 loss of function decreases recycling of internalized GluR1 and 
GluR2 (271). This effect is mediated, at least for GluR2, by an activity-dependent 
interaction between Neep21 and GRIP1, since disrupting this interaction causes 
GluR2, but not GluR1 or transferrin receptor, to accumulate in early endosomes and 
lysosomes (270). Consistent with a function of Neep21 in activity-dependent recy-
cling of AMPA receptor, disrupting Neep21 expression in hippocampal slices im-
pairs LTP (3). The activity dependence of the Neep21/GRIP1 interaction suggests"

C. Hanus and M.D. Ehlers 
 
that synaptic activity defines the fraction of internalized receptor that is sorted for 
recycling at a given synapse, and conversely that this sorting step might tune the 
amount of receptor available for activity-dependent synaptic potentiation. 
Overexpressing dominant-inhibitory mutants of Rab11a, Rme1/EHD1, or syn-
taxin-13, three molecules required form endocytic recycling, Park et al. (2004) (212) 
directly tested the role of REs in excitatory receptor trafficking (Fig. 6a). An impor-
tant finding of this study was that blocking post-endocytic recycling not only de-
creases the basal level of surface AMPA receptors, but also prevents the rapid 
NMDA receptor-dependent insertion of GluR1 at hippocampal synapses, as well as 
LTP expression at Schaffer collateral/CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices. Finally, 
by selectively tagging or masking those receptors originally at the plasma membrane 
or those receptors cycling between the cell-surface and endocytic structures, this 
study established that AMPA receptors rapidly recruited at synapses are mobilized 
from a pool of internalized molecules, demonstrating the fundamental importance of 
REs in synapse plasticity. 
4.2.4 Endosomal Recycling as a Cellular Basis for Spine Structural Plasticity  
While mature neurons maintain their overall size and architecture over years, den-
dritic spines can be highly dynamic, growing and shrinking over minutes (184, 198). 
At the scale of the entire cell, endocytosis and exocytosis balance each other to main-
tain cellular surface area. However, the continuous appearance and disappearance of 
some dendritic spines necessarily requires increases or decreases in local membrane 
area. One attractive mechanism for refining spine morphology is local addition or 
removal of membrane by exocytosis and endocytosis. Indeed, the observation that 
spine volume correlates with the size of the PSD, the number of postsynaptic AMPA 
receptors and the abundance of spine endomembranes (100, 169, 182, 283) suggests 
a quantitative coupling between membrane trafficking, synaptic strength, and spine 
size. Consistent with this notion, LTP- and LTD-inducing stimuli trigger an increase 
or decrease in spine size, respectively (151, 183, 194, 207, 308). 
The source of membrane for local spine growth has been a matter of debate since 
the dendritic shaft, and in some cases the spine head itself, house a wide array of 
endomembranes (135), and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton alone can expand 
cellular membranes (70). The recently recognized contribution of endosomal recy-
cling in glutamatergic synapse maintenance and plasticity prompted experiments to 
test whether REs contribute to spine growth. Combining three-dimensional serial 
reconstruction electron microscopy and high resolution fluorescence timelapse imag-
ing, Park et al. (2006) (213) showed that spine growth is correlated with both the 
translocation of endosomal compartments in growing spines and the local exocytosis 
of RE cargo, occurring in some instances directly in the spine head (Fig. 6b). Fur-
thermore, Rab11a and syntaxin 13 mutants that block endosomal recycling impair 
stimulus-induced spine growth, thus demonstrating that recycling endosomes con-
tribute membrane material for spine growth (213). By supplying both AMPA recep-
tors (212) and membrane material (213) during LTP, activity-induced cargo transport 
from recycling endosomes provides an attractive mechanism for coupling functional 
and structural plasticity at glutamatergic synapses."

Intriguingly, the importance of Rab11-dependent membrane recycling in the con-
trol of cell geometry seems to extend beyond plastic changes of spine morphology, 
as indicated by the recent characterization of protrudin, a mammalian Rab11-GDP 
binding protein which promotes and controls neurite formation (259). Spatially di-
rected membrane trafficking from recycling endosomes may thus be a general 
mechanism for neuronal growth and structural plasticity during the elaboration and 
remodeling of diverse neural circuits.
5 Concluding Remarks 
The discovery that membrane trafficking underlies diverse forms of neuronal plastic-
ity represents a major advance, providing a focal point for experiments addressing 
the basic mechanisms of learning and memory. Many core issues of neuronal devel-
opment and circuit plasticity can now be framed as cell biological problems, raising 
fundamental questions as to how conserved cellular machinery (Fig. 1) has evolved 
and adapted to serve specialized functions in the mammalian brain. Though far from 
complete, a picture is emerging of a previously unanticipated and remarkable degree 
of molecular dynamics at synapses orchestrated by conserved trafficking machinery 
and diverse dendritic organelles which are regulated by synaptic activity. These 
molecular dynamics function to maintain reliable, but still exquisitely plastic, com-
munication between highly interconnected cells (Fig. 4). While general rules cou-
pling changes of synaptic strength to membrane trafficking are becoming clarified, 
our understanding of how cell biological events coordinate neuronal physiology is 
still constrained by unresolved questions. What controls the organization and distri-
bution of dendritic organelles themselves? To what extent are changes in synaptic 
strength confined to specific synapses, and under which circumstances? What is the 
molecular machinery that couples neural activity to dendritic membrane trafficking? 
While much recent work has focused on the trafficking of postsynaptic receptors 
to and from the synapse, it is clear that the trafficking of other synaptic proteins, such 
as adhesion molecules (83, 224, 247), CaMKII (80), PSD-95 (44, 65, 78, 254), and 
gephyrin (94, 172) is equally important in tuning synaptic properties (116). A de-
tailed description of the fundamental organization of neuronal organelles will be 
essential to understand how the regulation of multiprotein complexes produces the 
requisite integration of diverse signals for coordinating functional and structural 
plasticity. The relative contribution of long-range versus local trafficking in the de-
velopment, maintenance, and plasticity of single synapses is not established. Within 
a given cell, mechanisms accounting for the turnover and plastic changes of synapses 
vary with synapse localization. For example, recent data suggest that endosomal 
trafficking and lateral diffusion may differentially contribute to postsynaptic recep-
tors at synapses localized near the soma and those localized to distal dendrites (2). In 
pyramidal neurons, Golgi outposts are present primarily in apical dendrites (108), 
suggesting distinct mechanisms in apical versus basolateral dendrites. Indeed syn-
apses onto these dendritic compartments contain different subclasses of NMDA 
receptors (131), and perhaps other molecules. One possibility is that a heterogeneous 
spatial restriction of neuronal organelles such as the Golgi apparatus, post-Golgi"

compartments, or various classes of endosomes contributes to spatial variation in 
synapse composition. 
At the level of single spines, the actin cytoskeleton is a central effector that cou-
ples morphological and functional synaptic plasticity. Although actin can directly 
affect the organization of the PSD itself (5, 37, 43, 149), its contribution to local 
spine membrane trafficking is only beginning to emerge. An intriguing observation 
is that while synaptic activity triggers the recruitment of membrane bound structures 
in the spine head (213, 282, 283), the diffusional coupling between the spine head 
and the dendritic shaft is simultaneously decreased (18). A detailed description of 
spine neck properties will be crucial to understand how calcium signaling, actin 
dynamics, and membrane trafficking are coordinated to control spine size and mo-
lecular composition. 
Finally, from a clinical perspective, recent findings illustrate how core issues of 
dendritic membrane trafficking open new perspectives for therapeutic strategies. For 
example, the Huntington’s disease protein huntingtin binds to proteins such as HIP 
(huntingtin interacting protein) 1 and HIP14 which participate in the control of in-
hibitory (142, 143, 156, 209) and excitatory receptor (113) turnover, respectively. 
The role of postsynaptic trafficking in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is particularly inter-
esting. It has been known for some time that the processing of the amyloid precursor 
protein during β-amyloid (Aβ) production occurs during trafficking through secre-
tory and endocytic compartments (93), and swollen neuronal endosomes correlate 
with disease in late-onset AD (34–36, 89, 199). Recent data indicate that Aβ release 
is activity-dependent, and liberated Aβ in turn attenuates synaptic strength (129) 
through mechanisms that share similarities with LTD, including increased endocyto-
sis of postsynaptic glutamate receptors (111, 129, 202, 253, 264). Conversely, Aβ 
oligomers block LTP (298) and presumably AMPA receptor insertion. Thus, it is 
tempting to speculate that at its early stages, AD is a disorder of postsynaptic traf-
ficking and synapse dysfunction. Beyond neurodegenerative diseases, alterations in 
glutamate receptor trafficking and defects in synaptic properties have been reported 
in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction (22, 304) and 
schizophrenia (153), as well as in models of congenital mental retardation (8, 15, 
109, 146). Autism has been associated with mutations in specific neuroligin isoforms 
(121). These mutations impair the expression of these adhesion molecules at the 
plasma membrane (42, 46), and are likely to have important consequences on synap-
tic properties given the importance of neuroligins in the clustering of postsynaptic 
proteins (83, 247). Regulation of dendritic organelles and trafficking machinery is 
thus requisite for modifying neural circuits during development and plasticity, and 
provides a novel venue for restoring neuronal function in injury and disease.

Structure and Mechanism of Action of AMPA

1 Introduction 
Structural studies on glutamate receptor ion channels (iGluRs) have reached a level 
of sophistication that was impossible to imagine when the individual receptor genes 
were cloned in the 1980s. Because these membrane proteins mediate excitatory 
responses at approximately 60% of synapses in the brain, they have attracted 
enormous interest due to their role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, 
development of the CNS, and disease. There has also been immense interest in 
understanding how these molecules work. In this chapter I will highlight some of the 
key advances in our understanding of the function of glutamate receptor ion channels 
which have arisen from structural work, and address some of the most important 
issues which remain unanswered. The results discussed focus almost entirely on 
AMPA and kainate receptors, while NMDA receptors are discussed in the chapter by 
Yuan et al. 
2 Molecular Architecture 
Our initial ideas about the structure of iGluRs were strongly influenced by prior 
work on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and related members of the cys loop family 
of ligand gated ion channels. These assemble as pentamers, with a barrel stave 
architecture in which the ion channel lies at the center of a 5-fold axis of symmetry 
(37). Five years after the first iGluR was cloned (14) a series of experiments using 
NICHD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA, mayerm@mail.NIH.gov 
principally biochemical and bioinformantic approaches revealed that iGluRs have a 
strikingly different architecture. Biochemical experiments using glycosidase 
sensitivity, and chimeric constructs to identify the extracellular ligand binding 
domain, unequivocally established the correct membrane topology of iGluRs (13,

40) and introduced the now widely used S1S2 nomenclature for labeling the pre and 
post ion channel segments of the ligand binding core. Bioinformantic studies played 
a key role in this work by revealing that iGluRs were modular proteins in which the 
individual domains showed sequence, and thus most likely structural homology with 
a series of bacterial proteins (20, 26, 40). Such approaches revealed that the ion 
channel of iGluRs has a pore loop motif like that in cyclic nucleotide and voltage-
gated ion channels (21), and that its structure must closely resemble that of KcsA, 
the first ion channel protein to be crystallized (10). This was reinforced by discovery 
of GluR0, a bacterial glutamate gated potassium selective ion channel with high 
be closely related in sequence and thus structure to a family of bacterial periplasmic 
proteins exemplified by glutamine binding protein (40). Finally, the 1st 400 or so 
amino acids of an iGluR subunit, which form the amino terminal domain (ATD), 
show sequence homology to a second family of periplasmic binding proteins of 
which leucine, isoleucine, valine binding protein (LIVBP) is the canonical member 
(28). A scheme illustrating how these domains are assembled in an individual iGluR 
subunit is shown in Fig. 1a. 
Fig. 1. Domain organization and activation mechanism for iGluR gating. (a ) shows a cartoon 
representation of a single iGluR submit, four of which coassemble to form an ion channel. The 
extracellular N-terminal is at the top and consists of the amino terminal domain (ATD), the 
ligand binding core composed of domains 1 and 2 (D1 and D2), with the ion channel linkers  
to the membrane embedded pore loop emerging from domain 2; the C-terminus is in the 
cytoplasm. (b ) shows a cartoon representation of an iGluR dimmer in the resting and active 
conformations (top) and corresponding iGluR crystal structures (bottom) with the separation

sequence homology to KcsA (7). Likewise, the ligand binding domain was shown to"

This assembly scheme reveals the surprising fact that the ligand binding domain 
is interrupted by insertion of the ion channel. This initially made no sense when the 
membrane topology of iGluRs was thought to be similar to that of the cys-loop 
family of ligand gated ion channels, since one half of the putative ligand binding 
domain was on the extracellular side of the post synaptic membrane, while the 
second half was on the intracellular side. Assignment of the correct membrane 
topology resolved this problem, but raised the question as to how the ligand binding 
domain could function when split into two halves by the membrane embedded ion 
channel segment. The answer to this question lies at the heart of how iGluRs use the 
conformational change induced by the binding of glutamate to gate the ion channel, 
and reveal a beautiful example of molecular evolution. The solution to the problem 
came from the combination of crystallography, patch clamp recording, and 
biophysical chemistry, and as a result we now have substantial insight into the 
mechanisms underlying iGluR activation, desensitization, allosteric modulation, and 
partial agonist activity. As important, we can now explain in atomic detail the 
selective binding properties of all of the major iGluR families, and several groups are 
using this information for the development subtype selective ligands, the availability 
of which will allow unprecedented functional studies to address the role of iGluRs in 
synaptic function. 
3 Mechanism of Activation by Glutamate 
The ligand binding domains of iGluRs are evolutionarily related to bacterial 
periplasmic binding proteins, the structures of numerous examples of which had 
been solved prior to the beginning of similar work on iGluRs. Thus, the idea that the 
individual ligand binding cores of iGluRs use a ‘Venus fly trap’ mechanism to bind 
glutamate had precedent from prior structural studies on bacterial periplasmic 
proteins, which crystallize in an ‘open’ conformation in the absence of substrate, and 
a ‘closed’ conformation when substrate is bound (34). The extent of domain closure 
in iGluRs, while not as large as observed in the fly trap of insectivorous plants, is 
nonetheless substantial, between 20–30°, and differs for individual ligands and 
iGluR subtypes. The ‘fly trap’ has two domains (D1 and D2) which are connected by 
a flexible hinge formed by antiparallel beta strands. The first crystal structure of an 
iGluR ligand binding domain revealed that insertion of the ion channel segment does 
not destroy its function because the linkers leading to the ion channel proper all 
emerge from the bottom surface of D2 (5). 
 
From a mechanistic perspective the most striking observation to emerge from 
structural studies was the discovery that the isolated ligand binding cores assemble 
as dimers (2), since this immediately suggested experimentally testable models for 
activation (Fig. 1b). Also important was the discovery that agonists, partial agonists, 
and competitive antagonists stabilize the ligand binding domain in different 
conformations. The dimers are formed by a back to back assembly, in which the 
intermolecular contacts stabilizing the dimer assembly are made exclusively by the 
rear surface of domain 1, so that the entrance to the ligand binding site faces 
outwards, and is accessible to the extracellular solution in the postsynaptic"

membrane, ready to bind glutamate. Ion channel activation occurs because, 
following the binding of glutamate, D2 in the pair of subunits in a dimer assembly 
moves in a scissors-like motion (Fig. 1b). This exerts strain on the ion channel, 
‘pulling’ it into the open conformation because the outward movement of D2 and its 
associated linkers applies force to the TM helices, which favors the open channel 
conformation. This model is bolstered by crystallographic studies on potassium 
channels, which reveal that in the closed conformation the channel has a teepee like 
structure (10), and that in the open conformation the smoke hole opens (17). 
 
Although this model for iGluR gating was developed using crystal structures of 
the isolated ligand binding domain, which constitutes roughly 25% of the mass of an 
intact iGluR, there is essentially no doubt that its is correct, although important 
details will only be resolved when we have crystal structures of full length iGluRs. 
Several experimental results give us confidence in this model. First, deletion of the 
ATD, which removes approximately 40% of the mass of an iGluR, leaves activation 
and desensitization intact, and in both AMPA and kainate receptors gating occurs 
with essentially wild type kinetics (15, 31, 33). Second, structural studies on 
potassium channels, some of which share a related gating mechanism, provide clear 
precedent for a mechanical linkage between the ion channel pore and the ligand 
binding domain. Third, iGluR dimers, chemically cross-linked via introduction of 
intermolecular disulfide bridges to trap them in the permissive conformation for 
activation by glutamate, continue to show normal ion channel activation (46). Key 
details missing from this picture include the lack of any real understanding of how 
the pair of dimers in a tetrameric iGluR assembly are packed with respect to each 
other, and knowledge of the extent of movement that occurs in the ion channel 
during the transition from the resting to open conformation. Although 
crystallographic studies with agonists and antagonists clearly reveal that the ligand 
binding domains can move large distances, it is by no means certain that the ion 
channel moves as much. The extent of movement will be determined by the structure 
of the linkers which connect the ion channel proper with D2; rigid linkers would 
impose large movements on the ion channel TM domains; flexible, perhaps 
disordered linkers, would absorb large movements, and impose much less force on 
the ion channel. 
 
An understanding of the structure of the dimer of dimers assembly that must 
occur in the extracellular segments of a tetrameric iGluR is critical to several issues. 
First, we have no real understanding of the extent of cross talk, if any, between the 
dimers; this will of course have a large impact on the cooperativity of ion channel 
activation. Second, lack of information about the connectivity between the ATD 
dimers and the ligand binding domain dimers prevents us from understanding how 
allosteric modulators act on the ATD to modulate ion channel gating. This is 
particularly important in the case of NMDA receptors (see chapter by Yuan et al.) 
Third, the transition from a dimer of dimers assembly to the ion channel segment, 
which must contain elements of 4-fold symmetry, presents the conundrum that, at 
least in homomeric iGluR assemblies, chemically identical peptide chains will need 
to assume different conformations to accommodate the symmetry mismatch. 
However, it is possible that in iGluRs the ion channel does not show perfect 4-fold"

symmetry, and recent work shows that the symmetry transition, if present, must 
occur below the extracellular entrance to the channel (39). 
4 Mechanism of Desensitization 
The dimer assembly of the iGluR ligand binding domains also suggests a mechanism 
for desensitization (Fig. 2a). Clues about the mechanism arose from a series of prior 
mutation of amino acids, which were subsequently mapped to the dimer interface 
observed in iGluR crystal structures, had profound effects on both the extent and 
Fig. 2. The mechanism of iGluR desensitization. (a) shows a cartoon representation of an

‘structure’-function studies which gave tantalizing hints about important sites in the 
protein but did not elucidate the underlying molecular events. The first corner stone 
was the observation that the desensitized state binds glutamate with high affinity, 
even though the ion channel is in a non-conducting conformation; thus the ligand 
binding domains must be in their closed cleft active conformation, even though the 
ion channel is also closed. The second clue came from studies which revealed that

kinetics of onset of desensitization (41), as well as on allosteric modulation by drugs 
like cyclothiazide and aniracetam (29, 30). The dimer assembly observed in AMPA 
receptor crystal structures provided an explanation for these results, and suggested 
that a pivoting motion of the pair of subunits in a dimer assembly, around an axis 
running close to the boundary between domains 1 and 2, would allow the ion channel 
linkers to relax back towards their resting position, shutting the ion channel, even 
though the individual ligand binding cores remained in their active closed cleft 
conformation (42). Direct support for this model came from combining the results of 
measurement of the affinity for dimer formation by a series of mutants of the isolated 
ligand binding cores, using analytical centrifugation, with functional measurements 
of the extent of desensitization measured in intact receptors, using rapid perfusion 
techniques and outside-out patch recording (42). This revealed that the rate of onset 
of desensitization was inversely correlated with the Kd for dimer formation by the 
isolated ligand binding cores: mutations that disrupted dimer formation accelerated 
desensitization, and mutations that stabilized the dimer slowed desensitization. 
Consistent with this, allosteric modulators that attenuate desensitization were found 
to stabilize dimer assemblies. Moreover, crystal structures of AMPA receptor 
complexes with cyclothiazide and aniracetam revealed that the modulators bind at 
the base of the dimer assembly, forming cross-links between each subunit, and 
sterically obstructing the rotation required to allow each of the subunits in a dimer 
pair to pivot into the desensitized state (19, 42). One key aspect of this model is that 
it implies that desensitization is a process that occurs within a dimer, and is not the 
result of a conformational change in individual iGluR subunits. This was further 
reinforced by disulfide cross linking experiments in which pairs of cysteine residues 
engineered into the dimer interface, to covalently trap the dimer in a conformation 
permissive for activation by glutamate, were shown to abolish desensitization (46). 
This result unambiguously establishes the dimer model for desensitization, and raises 
the question of how much cross talk, if any, occurs between dimer partners in AMPA 
and kainate receptors. 
 
Hints about the structure of the desensitized state came from a clever series of 
experiments in which the pair of subunits in a glutamate bound GluR2 dimer were 
individually docked onto the domain 2 coordinates of the GluR2 apo crystal structure 
to generate a 1st approximation of the conformation of the desensitized state. The 
resulting model structure suggested the location of positions at which cysteine 
residues could be introduced to trap the receptor in the desensitized state (3). These 
mutants were then tested in functional assays using intact receptors, searching for 
positions at which reducing agents produced a large potentiation of glutamate 
responses following the introduction of cysteine residues. Once these sites were 
identified, the corresponding cross-linked dimer was crystallized to reveal the 
conformation of the desensitized state (Fig. 2b). As expected, both ligand binding 
cores remain in their closed cleft glutamate bound conformation, but due to pivoting 
around an axis parallel to the dimer interface, the separation of the domain 2 linkers 
that lead to the ion channel, decreases by nearly 14Å, which is sufficient to allow the 
ion channel to enter a non-conducting state, which however is not necessarily the 
same as the resting closed state (3). Further support for a partial collapse of the dimer 
interface during entry into the desensitized state came from measuring the state"

dependence of accessibility of additional positions for which introduction of mutant 
cysteine residues did not form spontaneous disulfide bonds in the resting, active or 
desensitized states, but which showed large increases in rate of reactivity when the 
receptor was desensitized. These positions mapped to structures that are buried in the 
resting and active conformations, but which become solvent exposed when the dimer 
collapses into its desensitized conformation. 
 
The conformational changes underlying activation and desensitization described 
in above sections are likely to apply in broad detail to all subtype of iGluRs, 
including NMDA receptors, although the extent of the allosteric coupling between 
the ligand binding domain and the ion channel clearly differs between receptor 
families. The basis for this is not well understood at present, and will likely only be 
revealed when structures are solved for intact receptors from members of several 
iGluR subtypes. Thus, despite the spectacular advances which have revealed the 
general mechanisms by which iGluRs work, our understanding of how individual 
receptor subtypes gain their unique functional properties is still quite vague. 
5 The Agonist Binding Site 
The ligand binding cores have been the subject of substantial structural work, and 
crystal structures have been solved for GluR2, GluR5, GluR6, NR1, NR2A, NR3A 
and NR3B, delta 2, as well as for GluR0, a prokaryotic glutamate receptor ion 
channel that plausibly represents an ancestral precursor to the large family of diverse 
iGluRs that have evolved in eukaryotes. At the time of writing the only missing 
members are the KA subtype kainate receptors. Strikingly different from the cys-
loop family of ligand gated ion channels, in which agonists bind at the interface 
between subunits, in iGluRs the agonist binding site is a self contained structure, four 
copies of which are present in each subunit. Thus, for AMPA and kainate receptors 
there are four glutamate binding sites per receptor, while for NMDA receptors there 
are two glycine and two glutamate binding sites (see chapter by Yuan et al.) 
 
The neurotransmitter L-glutamate is a bifunctional molecule in which the alpha 
carboxylate and ammonium groups interact principally with domain 1, while the 
gamma carboxylate group interacts exclusively with domain 2 (Fig. 3). A conserved 
arginine side chain forms a salt bridge with the agonist alpha carboxylate group, 
while main chain amide and carbonyl groups form hydrogen bonds with the alpha 
carboxylate and ammonium groups respectively. Coordination of the alpha 
ammonium group is in addition mediated via a salt bridge with a conserved 
glutamate or aspartate side chain (Glu707 in Fig. 3), but this interaction is 
conformation specific, occurs only in the closed cleft active conformation, and is not 
possible in the apo state because the acidic side chain is blocked by formation of a 
salt bridge with a lysine side chain that projects up from one of the interdomain beta 
strands that form the base of the ligand binding domain (2). Thus, during the initial 
encounter of glutamate with the receptor, the ligand alpha carbon carboxylate and 
amino groups most likely dock with the domain 1 binding site, displacing bound 
water molecules, and only after this complex is formed does cleft closure and 
glutamate interaction with domain 2 occur (1, 4). This picture has been reinforced by"

studies using time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy which reveals that formation of 
the initial iGluR agonist complex starts with the docking of glutamate at the alpha-
carboxylate moiety and ends with the formation of interactions between the gamma 
carboxylate of glutamate and the protein (9).Within domain 2, a conserved threonine 
or serine side chain near the tip of helix F acts as the hydrogen bond donor for the 
agonist gamma carboxylate group, while main chain amides in helix F act as 
hydrogen bond donors for both the alpha and gamma agonist carboxyl groups. The 
large conformational difference between the apo and glutamate bound structures has 
the consequence that agonist interactions with helix F occur only in the active, 
closed-cleft conformation. 
 
The formation of protein-protein bonds between domains 1 and 2 which are 
conformation specific, and formed only in the closed cleft conformation, also help to 
stabilize the active state of the agonist receptor complex (35). Amino acid sequence 
differences between AMPA and kainate receptors involved in such contacts is one of 
the mechanisms that contributes to the different kinetics of AMPA and kainate

receptor gating. The stability of the closed cleft glutamate bound conformation is 
determined in part by residues at the lip of the clam shell, which differ in GluR2 and 
GluR6. Exchange of these tunes the kinetics of deactivation and recovery from 
desensitization (45). Such experiments produced both AMPA receptor gain of 
function mutants, in which the time constant of recovery from desensitization for 
GluR2 was slowed 5-fold, by introducing pairs of aspartate residues from kainate 
receptors in place of the alanine and serine residues in wild type GluR2, as well as 
kainate receptor loss of function mutants in which the time constant of recovery from 
desensitization was increased up to six-fold by breaking interdomain contacts in 
GluR6 (45). 
 
At the time of writing only two iGluR apo structures have been solved, those for 
GluR2 and delta 2 and these give us our sole view of the resting state of an iGluR 
ligand binding domain dimer assembly. For other receptor subtypes we have a series of 
competitive antagonist structures, which might be considered equivalent to the apo 
state, and indeed clearly define the mechanism of action of competitive antagonists as 
due to steric occlusion via a foot in the door effect, which prevents the domain closure 
necessary to trigger ion channel activation. These structures reveal a surprisingly large 
range of differences in domain closure relative to the GluR2 apo structure, and indicate 
that in order to be able to bind antagonists of different structure the iGluR ligand 
binding cores must be extremely flexible proteins which can sample a wide range of 
conformations in solution, and also in the intact protein. Without additional apo 
structures it is not possible to determine if some of these antagonist structures are 
hyper-extended compared to the apo conformation, and even when this information 
becomes available, we will need to consider that the conformation of the apo state 
observed in crystal structures is likely to some unknown degree to be influenced by 
contacts with the crystal lattice and/or NCS related molecules. One solution to this 
problem would be to obtain high resolution NMR structures of the isolated ligand 
binding domain, but even this leaves unaddressed a second concern that excision from 
the ion channel frees the ligand binding domain from steric constraints which might 
limit its range of motion in an intact receptor. Even with all of these caveats in mind, it 
is remarkable how much insight has been gained into iGluR function from study of the 
isolated ligand binding domains. 
6 Chemistry of Ligand Binding and Subtype Pharmacology 
Because the structure of the domain 1 binding site is highly conserved in different 
iGluRs (Fig. 3), virtually all of the selectivity for drugs which bind to the discrete 
subtypes of iGluRs arises from amino acid sequence variations in the domain 2 
surface of the ligand binding site. Thus, with crystal structures in hand, the structural 
basis for the rich pharmacology of iGluRs can now be understood and exploited for 
drug design. There is a surprisingly large variation in volume of the ligand binding 
cavity in individual iGluRs, which ranges from about 50Å3 in the NR1, NR3A and 
NR3B subunits, to 218 Å3 for GluR2, 255 Å3 for GluR6 and 305Å3 for GluR5. In all 
of these structures agonists are buried in the interior of the protein and are 
completely desolvated with respect to bulk solvent. In the case of AMPA and kainate"
572,"===== Page 10 =====
260 
Mark L. Mayer 
 
receptors, the ligand binding cavity is much larger than necessary to bind glutamate, 
and contains well ordered water molecules, which essentially act in combination 
with glutamate as surrogate ligand atoms. Thus, although glutamate interacts with 
highly conserved structures in the ligand binding domains of the 9 AMPA and 
kainate receptor genes, in the surrounding protein landscape there exist cavities and 
protrusions, with unique chemical profiles. These permit the high affinity binding of 
AMPA to GluR1-4, but absolutely exclude AMPA binding to GluR6 by steric 
occlusion (23). Similar steric exclusion mechanisms underlie the selective binding of 
5-substituted willardiine agonists to GluR5 but not GluR6 subtype kainate receptors, 
and the high selectivity of the competitive antagonist UBP310 for GluR5 versus 
AMPA receptors, and other subtypes of kainate receptor (24). As discussed later, 
steric effects also play a key role in the mechanism of action of partial agonists. In 
the case of the NR1, NR3A and NR3B subunits, which bind glycine, the small size 
of the ligand binding cavity cannot accommodate glutamate due to steric clash with 
the gamma carboxylate group, and this simple fact explains the exquisite 
discrimination by these subunits between glutamate and glycine. 
 
The chemistry of ligand interaction with iGluRs is enormously rich, and much 
more complex than we can explain. That is, in most cases we are unable to predict 
the affinity of ligand binding with any degree of accuracy. The reasons for this are 
complex, but include the complex electrostatic environment of the ligand binding 
site; the need to model solvent structure in the ligand binding site and how this is 
altered upon ligand binding; the need to describe the change in entropy of ligands 
with highly mobile groups on transfer from solution to the conformation adopted 
when bound to the protein; the change in solvation energy of ligand upon transfer 
from solution into the ligand binding site; and of course the energy difference 
between the apo and ligand bound conformational states of the protein. As a ‘simple’ 
example it is interesting to consider the case of 2S,4R-4-methylglutamate, a potent 
kainate receptor agonist that has been widely used in radioligand binding assays 
because of its high affinity compared to glutamate. The addition of a single methyl 
group to the Cγ atom of glutamate, to yield 2S,4R-4-methylglutamate, increases 
affinity for GluR6 by 40-fold, from a Kd of 1.4 µM to 36 nM, but decreases affinity 
for GluR2 by 33-fold, from a Kd of 0.8 µM to 27 µM. How does addition of a single 
methyl group to glutamate have such a dramatic and selective effect? Crystal 
structures of the GluR6 ligand complexes reveal that the mechanism of binding of 
2S,4R-4-methylglutamate to GluR6 is identical to that for glutamate, with the 
exception that the 4-methyl group makes additional van der Waals contacts with 
Tyrosine 457 and Valine 654. Least squares superposition of Cα positions for the 
GluR6 glutamate and 2S,4R-4-methylglutamate structures gave rmsds of 0.12 Å 
indicating essentially identical structures. The extent of domain closure in the 2S,4R-
4-methylglutamate and glutamate structures, 26.4° and 26.6° is also identical within 
the limits of experimental error (23). 
 
The following three differences between glutamate and its 4-methyl derivative 
are sufficient to explain with quite good accuracy the difference in binding energy of 
the two compounds. First, addition of the methyl group to give the 4R enantiomer 
introduces a steric barrier that favors the conformation glutamate adopts when bound 
to GluR6; this gives about a 1.34 kcal per mole increase in binding energy. Second,"
573,"===== Page 11 =====
Structure and Mechanism of Action of AMPA and Kainate Receptors
261
 
the methyl group is shielded from bulk solvent in the GluR6 complex, and this 
transfer from an aqueous environment to a hydrophobic cavity yields about 1.2 kcal 
per mole; third, van der Waals contacts of the ligand methyl group with the greasy 
methylene atoms of the Tyrosine 457 and Valine 654 side chains gives a boost in 
affinity of somewhat less than a kcal per mole. In contrast, for AMPA receptors, the 
substitution of a larger leucine side chain at the position equivalent to valine 654, 
introduces a steric clash with the 4-methyl group, which requires the receptor 
binding site to expand to relieve the steric constraint, explaining why glutamate 
binds with higher affinity than its 4-methyl derivative. From this example one begins 
to see that computational docking experiments that ignore the complex chemistry of 
ligand binding are unlikely to accurately predict ligand affinity, although of course 
they are still very valuable tools for drug design, since they can eliminate many poor 
candidates, and aid in the design of new drugs that can be tested experimentally with 
increased anticipation of a successful outcome as a result of rational drug design.  
7 Mechanism of Partial Agonist Activity 
A large number of AMPA and kainate receptor agonist complexes have been solved 
for GluR2, GluR5, GluR6 and these revealed the striking observation that for a given 
receptor species and crystal system, the extent of domain closure differed by less 
than 1° for most agonists. In contrast, there is a much greater extent of variation in 
the range of domain closure observed for competitive antagonists, even though the 
number of antagonist structures solved is substantially less. This difference in extent 
of domain closure for antagonists clearly results from steric effects, and suggests that 
the ligand binding cores can expand and contract to bind antagonists of different size 
and shape without activation of ion channel gating. Thus, the ligand binding domains 
do not switch between single open and closed conformations, as required by the 
simplest Monod Wyman Changeux models of allostery, and instead exhibit induced 
fit to accommodate a range of ligands sizes. This naturally raises the question of 
whether there is a threshold for domain closure, the crossing of which triggers ion 
channel gating. This is indeed true and in fact is one of the major mechanisms which 
underlies the action of AMPA and kainate receptor partial agonists. Most work has 
been done for AMPA receptors, and the results suggest that even the 12° domain 
closure produced by the partial agonist kainate produces at most a few percent of the 
activation produced by the full agonists glutamate, AMPA, and quisqualate (4). 
 
Two sets of experiments provide unequivocal support for a mechanism by which 
the extent of domain closure directly controls the extent of receptor activation by 
partial agonists. The first involved measurement of both the extent of domain closure 
for a series of 5-substituted willardiines, for which crystal structures were solved for 
the hydro-, fluoro-, bromo-, and iodo-derivatives, as well as measurement of the 
extent of activation of GluR2 by these agonists in the presence and absence of the 
allosteric modulator cyclothiazide (18). When desensitization was blocked the results 
revealed a strong correlation between domain closure and efficacy. Due to steric 
constraints, the extent of domain closure was determined by size of the 5-substituent, 
and followed the sequence H > F > Br > I, with the same sequence for peak current 
amplitudes. Conversely, when desensitization was intact, there was an inverse"
574,"===== Page 12 =====
262 
Mark L. Mayer 
 
correlation between domain closure and the amplitude of equilibrium responses; this 
occurs because the least efficacious agonists also produce the smallest extent of 
desensitization. The logical continuation of this sequence extends to competitive 
antagonists, which of course produce neither activation nor desensitization. Studies 
with additional compounds confirm and extend this model for partial agonist activity 
and reveal that it is common to both AMPA and kainate receptors (12, 23, 27). 
Additional support for this mechanism came from protein engineering studies in 
which steric interactions with the ligand isopropenyl group were reduced by 
replacing the wild type Leu650 side chain with the smaller threonine residue (4). As 
expected this increased the efficacy of kainate, from 2% to 24% relative to the 
response to glutamate without altering the maximum response to quisqualate. 
Crystallization of the L650T mutant complex with kainate revealed a 3° increase in 
domain closure relative to the wild type complex, but this small change in domain 
closure has large effects on the efficiency of ion channel activation. 
 
A surprising result of these studies is the extreme sensitivity of receptor 
activation to very small changes in domain closure, which reinforces two ideas 
discussed above. First, there is a threshold extent of domain closure required to 
trigger ion channel gating, and this requires quite large movements, about a 10° 
domain closure for AMPA receptors. Second, it is likely that the ion channel linkers 
are not rigid structures, and instead can absorb large movements of the ligand 
binding domain without disturbing the closed conformation of the ion channel. A 
surprising advantage come from this seemingly inefficient design: domain closure 
due to thermal vibration of the ligand binding domains, which could cause 
spontaneous ion channel activation, and degrade the fidelity of synaptic 
transmission, would be substantially reduced. This view presupposes that the 
membrane embedded ion channel domain is quite rigid, but this is consistent with the 
view that has emerged from crystallographic studies on potassium channels (16). 
Structural studies on intact iGluRs are required to test these ideas. 
 
The above picture leaves unaddressed some very important issues, which 
complicate any analysis of iGluR gating mechanisms. The first is that measurements of 
macroscopic current amplitudes, which average out the activity of single ion channels, 
hide the fact that for AMPA receptors the ion channel opens to a number of substates 
varies with concentration of glutamate (36, 38). This behavior has been successfully 
incorporated into a kinetic model for partial agonist activity in which a coupling 
constant, which varies with domain closure, was used to describe substate occupancy 
as a function of ligand concentration (18). This model builds on prior work suggesting 
that each ligand binding core can act somewhat independently to activate ion channel 
gating, but obtaining a realistic kinetic model of the single channel activity of AMPA 
receptors remains a formidable goal. Surprisingly, it is less clear that the same general 
model can be used to describe kainate receptor gating, since the available evidence 
suggests that concentration dependent ion channel substates may not occur (38). If true 
this would further complicate our limited understanding of partial agonist activity, 
since crystal structures for GluR6 reveal that as for AMPA receptors, kainic and 
domoic acid produce intermediate degrees of domain closure consistent with their 
action as kainate receptor partial agonists. 
of lower conductance, and that the relative substate occupancy and life time of these"

A second major issue largely ignored by current models for iGluR gating arises 
from the fact that following the binding of glutamate, the ion channel oscillates 
between open and closed states, producing bursts of openings while the agonist 
remains bound. The molecular identity of the glutamate bound state when the ion 
channel is closed is not known, but it seems unlikely that it reflects transitions 
between the open and closed cleft conformations observed in crystal structures for 
the apo and glutamate bound structures. It is possible that the clam shell partially 
opens, to an extent sufficient to permit ion channel closure, perhaps to a 
conformation like that observed in the AMPA bound complex of the GluR2 L650T 
mutant (4). The extremely short open times, and relatively low conductance of 
AMPA receptor substates, complicates the experiments needed to explore these 
issues, and as discussed in the chapter by Yuan et al., much better data is starting to 
emerge for NMDA receptors, which open for longer times, and to fewer 
subconductance states, than AMPA and kainate receptors. 
 
Although to a first approximation the domain closure model accounts for partial 
agonist action quite well, additional details are required to accurately describe iGluR 
gating. It is clear from the results of FTIR spectroscopy that the energy of interaction 
of the alpha carbon amine group with the receptor differs for individual ligands, and 
although steric mechanisms dictate the extent of domain closure possible for many 
AMPA and kainate receptor agonists, binding energy is also an important 
determinant of agonist efficacy (22). Recent work showing that mutations of amino 
acids in the ligand binding core of AMPA receptors that contribute to stabilization of 
the closed cleft conformation alter agonist efficacy illustrates another example of 
how receptor activity can be controlled (35). 
 
Any discussion of AMPA receptor gating is now incomplete without description 
of the modulatory effect of a recently discovered family of proteins named TARPs, 
short for transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (44). There is a 
growing body of evidence, including studies with single particle electron microscopy 
(25), which indicate that TARPs are integral components of native AMPA receptors 
in at least some cell types. Whether this is true for all AMPA receptors is not yet 
established. The issue is complicated by the fact that TARPs have two distinct 
functions. First, in some cell types, and especially cerebellar granule cells where 
their biological role was first discovered (8), association of AMPA receptors with 
TARPs is essential for both cell surface expression and targeting to synapses. 
However, in addition to this, coexpression with TARPs modulates AMPA receptor 
gating, increasing the efficacy of activation by agonists, and slowing deactivation 
and desensitization (43). At the time of writing no TARP-like partners have been 
found for other iGluR subtypes, but the extreme mismatch in kinetics for 
synaptically activated kainate receptor responses with those for kainate receptors 
expressed in heterologous systems such as HEK cells is striking, and might be 
resolved if such proteins were discovered.

to generate depolarizing responses at synapses. The extracellular and intracellular 
concentrations of the major biological cations and anions, Na+, K+ and Cl–, are quite 
tightly regulated, albeit subject to transient changes during intense bursts of synaptic 
activity or during spreading depression. It is thus surprising that kainate receptors in 
particular, and AMPA receptors to a lesser extent, show profound modulation by 
changes in monovalent ion concentration and species (6, 32). Recent structural work 
has identified the site and mechanism of action of anions on kainate receptors, and 
reveals, unexpectedly that chloride ions are integral components of a kainate receptor 
dimer in its active conformation (33). The anion binding site shows exquisite 
selectivity, and strongly prefers chloride and bromide over fluoride and iodide; larger 
organic anions, like nitrate, methanesulfonate and sulfate also do not substitute for 
Cl–. All kainate receptor subunits, i.e. GluR5, GluR6 and GluR7, expressed either 
alone or in combination with the KA1 or KA2 subunits, require chloride for normal 
 
Crystal structures of the chloride and bromide bound complexes reveal in detail 
the mechanism of anion binding (Fig. 4). The Cl– ion shows six-fold coordination by 
the ammonium groups of Lys516 (3.67 Å), the guanidinium groups of Arg760 (3.4 
Å), and a pair of equatorial water molecules (2.81 Å) which form hydrogen bonds 
with the side chain hydroxyl groups of Thr764. The bound anion is located on the 
molecular two-fold axis of symmetry at the dimer interface, 10 Å below the top 
surface of domain 1, defined by the ridge of methyl groups formed by Pro758. A 
single Cl– or Br– ion together with two water molecules is trapped in a cavity of 
volume 70 Å3 located between the pair of subunits in a dimer assembly. The lid of 
the cavity is formed by a pair of intermolecular salt bridges between the side chains 
of Arg760 and Asp761. The carboxyl group of Asp761 is only 4.4 Å from the Cl– 
ion, and is presumably shielded by formation of bidentate intermolecular salt bridges 
with Arg760 of the dimer partner (2.84 and 2.91 Å) and hydrogen bond formation 
with the trapped water molecules (2.66 Å) and solvent outside the anion binding 
cavity. The base of the cavity is formed by another pair of salt bridges formed 
between the side chains of Glu509 and Lys516. The structure is remarkable for the 
close apposition of multiple charged side chains which, to a first approximation, 
form counterbalanced rings of charge around the top of the dimer interface.  
 
 
gating. Crystallographic studies reveal that the anion binding site is formed at the D1 
interface between a pair of subunits in a dimer assembly, and that chloride acts as a 
counter ion to a positively charged cavity, and thus provides electrostatic glue which 
contributes binding energy to dimer stabilization. Consistent with this, in functional 
experiments removal of chloride has two effects. First it accelerates the rate of onset 
of desensitization, reflecting reduced stability of the dimer assembly. Second, it 
reduces the peak current amplitude, by lowering open channel probability and the 
number of receptors competent for activation by glutamate. This effect was 
interpreted as a consequence of binding of glutamate to anion free receptors resulting 
in the triggering of either of two events: dimer rearrangement before the ion channel 
opens, or normal activation, but with a reduced stability of the active conformation."

Although these structural results are compelling, kainate receptor crystals grown 
in different conditions did not consistently exhibit the mode of anion binding 
described above. For crystals grown in the presence of high concentrations of sulfate, 
the structural data make sense and the χ4 dihedral angle of the pair of Arg760 
residues in the dimer complex is rotated by 94° compared to the Cl– complex, so that 
the guanidinium groups point upwards towards the solvent exposed SO4
2– ion, thus 
breaking the intermolecular salt bridges with Asp761. This is consistent with our 
functional studies, for which substitution of 150 mM NaCl by either 75 or 150 mM 
Na2SO4 increased the rate of onset of desensitization for GluR6 and reduced the peak 
amplitude of responses to glutamate. However, in other cases structures of anion 
bound complexes appear to have no biological significance. 
 
To validate identification of the anion binding site revealed by structural studies, 
mutants were designed to perturb the anion binding site and examined for changes in 
gating kinetics and sensitivity to anions. The predicted results from these 
experiments were loss of function phenotypes, since perturbing the binding site 
would be expected to destabilize anion binding, and thus accelerate the rate of onset 
of desensitization. The results obtained with even conservative mutations to anion 
binding site residues were consistent with this prediction and the R744K and T748N 
mutations in GluR6 accelerated the rate of onset of desensitization 2 and 6-fold 
respectively. Of more interest, these mutations changed the rank order of sensitivity 
to anion modulation, which is consistent with the functional effects of anions being

mediated by the binding site identified in structural experiments. Consistent with this 
mechanism, anion modulation was not altered in the GluR6 ATD(-) deletion 
construct, but was blocked when the D1 interfaces were locked in their active 
conformation by introduction of intermolecular cross links.  
9 Conclusion 
Clearly, with just 25% of the mass of a typical iGluR crystallized, understanding the 
domain organization of an intact tetrameric iGluR assembly, even at low resolution, 
would be a tremendous advance. Achieving this will be a heroic undertaking, but 
ultimately without this information we will never really understand how iGluRs 
work. Adding to the complexity of this picture, structures with TARPs will be 
necessary to understand AMPA receptor function, and perhaps similar proteins will 
be identified for other iGluR subtypes in the future. Structural studies are also the 
only way to try and begin to understand how phosphorylation, and other forms of 
cytoplasmic modulation alter the probability of ion channel gating. An understanding 
of the mechanism of folding and assembly of an iGluR, and its coassembly with 
chaperones and transport partners is beginning to emerge (11), but the molecular 
mechanisms are a long way from being understood in structural terms. In the near 
future it is to be anticipated that the rational design of subtype selective ligands will 
be achieved with increasing frequency, which will finally provide tools to begin to 
cleanly answer questions about the diverse biology of iGluRs in synaptic pathways 
throughout the CNS and spinal cord. Even with the ligand binding cores many 
important issues remain to be sorted out, and likely this will result in the 
identification of new sites of action of allosteric modulators.

1 Introduction 
Intracellular membrane trafficking is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells, but 
it is particularly critical at synaptic terminals, where a large number of specific ion 
channels, scaffolding molecules and multiple signal transduction regulators have to 
be precisely targeted to ensure proper synaptic function (80, 126). At the level of the 
postsynaptic terminal, local membrane trafficking is now appreciated as major factor 
controlling synaptic function (58). In particular, the regulation of neurotransmitter 
receptor transport and targeting is crucial for the maintenance of synaptic strength, 
and for the activity-dependent changes associated to synaptic plasticity (19). 
Most excitatory transmission in the central nervous system is mediated by two 
types of glutamate receptors: γ-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic 
acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. These two types of 
receptors have very different roles in synaptic function (22, 51). AMPA receptors 
(AMPARs) mediate most excitatory (depolarizing) currents in conditions of basal 
neuronal activity. Hence, they have a major influence in the strength of the synaptic 
response. NMDA receptors (NMDARs), on the other hand, remain silent at resting 
membrane potential (85), but they are crucial for the induction of specific forms of 
synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression 
(LTD) (6). Although AMPARs and NMDARs reside at the same synapses in most 
brain regions, they traffic to the synaptic membrane through quite different pro-
grams. In the brain, soon after birth, most excitatory synapses in the hippocampus 
and other brain regions contain only NMDARs, whereas the prevalence of AMPARs 
increases gradually over development (24, 53, 55, 73, 92). In fact, the delivery of 
AMPARs into synapses is a regulated process that depends on NMDAR activation 
and underlies some forms of synaptic plasticity (78).
